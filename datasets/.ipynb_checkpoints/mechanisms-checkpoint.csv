Self-Healing Mechanism of Lithium in Lithium Metal.,"Li is an ideal anode material for use in state-of-the-art secondary batteries. However, Li-dendrite growth is a safety concern and results in low coulombic efficiency, which significantly restricts the commercial application of Li secondary batteries. Unfortunately, the Li-deposition (growth) mechanism is poorly understood on the atomic scale. Here, machine learning is used to construct a Li potential model with quantum-mechanical computational accuracy. Molecular dynamics simulations in this study with this model reveal two self-healing mechanisms in a large Li-metal system, viz. surface self-healing, and bulk self-healing. It is concluded that self-healing occurs rapidly in nanoscale; thus, minimizing the voids between the Li grains using several comprehensive methods can effectively facilitate the formation of dendrite-free Li.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",eng,2022,Apr
Repair mechanism and application of self-healing materials for food preservation.,"The traditional packaging concept has reached its limits when it comes to ensuring the quality of food and extending its shelf life. Compared to traditional packaging materials, food packaging with self-healing function is becoming more and more popular. This is because they can automatically repair the damaged area, restore the original properties and prevent the decline of food quality and loss of nutrients. Materials based on various self-healing mechanisms have been developed and used on a laboratory scale in the form of coatings and films for food packaging. However, more efforts are needed for the commercial application of these new self-healing packaging materials. Understanding the self-healing mechanism of these packaging materials is very important for their commercial application. This article first discusses the self-healing mechanism of different packaging materials and compares the self-healing efficiency of self-healing materials under different conditions. Then, the application potential of self-healing coatings and films in the food industry is systematically analyzed. Finally, we give an outlook on the application of self-healing materials in the field of food packaging.",Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,eng,2023,Jul
Recent Advances in Intrinsic Self-Healing Cementitious Materials.,"Self-healing is a natural phenomenon whereby living organisms respond to damage.

The Versatility of Polymeric Materials as Self-Healing Agents for Various Types of Applications: A Review.,"The versatility of polymeric materials as healing agents to prevent any structure failure and their ability to restore their initial mechanical properties has attracted interest from many researchers. Various applications of the self-healing polymeric materials are explored in this paper. The mechanism of self-healing, which includes the extrinsic and intrinsic approaches for each of the applications, is examined. The extrinsic mechanism involves the introduction of external healing agents such as microcapsules and vascular networks into the system. Meanwhile, the intrinsic mechanism refers to the inherent reversibility of the molecular interaction of the polymer matrix, which is triggered by the external stimuli. Both self-healing mechanisms have shown a significant impact on the cracked properties of the damaged sites. This paper also presents the different types of self-healing polymeric materials applied in various applications, which include electronics, coating, aerospace, medicals, and construction fields. It is expected that this review gives a significantly broader idea of self-healing polymeric materials and their healing mechanisms in various types of applications.",Polymers,eng,2021,Apr
Transformation of Construction Cement to a Self-Healing Hybrid Binder.,"A new biomimetic strategy to im prove the self-healing properties of Portland cement is presented that is based on the application of the biogenic inorganic polymer polyphosphate (polyP), which is used as a cement admixture. The data show that synthetic linear polyp, with an average chain length of 40, as well as natural long-chain polyP isolated from soil bacteria, has the ability to support self-healing of this construction material. Furthermore, polyP, used as a water-soluble Na-salt, is subject to Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cement, resulting in the formation of a water-rich coacervate when added to the cement surface, especially to the surface of bacteria-containing cement/concrete samples. The addition of polyP in low concentrations (<1% on weight basis for the solids) not only accelerated the hardening of cement/concrete but also the healing of microcracks present in the material. The results suggest that long-chain polyP is a promising additive that increases the self-healing capacity of cement by mimicking a bacteria-mediated natural mechanism.",International journal of molecular sciences,eng,2019,Jun
Thermoresponsive Gels.,"Thermoresponsive gelling materials constructed from natural and synthetic polymers can be used to provide triggered action and therefore customised products such as drug delivery and regenerative medicine types as well as for other industries. Some materials give Arrhenius-type viscosity changes based on coil to globule transitions. Others produce more counterintuitive responses to temperature change because of agglomeration induced by enthalpic or entropic drivers. Extensive covalent crosslinking superimposes complexity of response and the upper and lower critical solution temperatures can translate to critical volume temperatures for these swellable but insoluble gels. Their structure and volume response confer advantages for actuation though they lack robustness. Dynamic covalent bonding has created an intermediate category where shape moulding and self-healing variants are useful for several platforms. Developing synthesis methodology-for example, Reversible Addition Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) and Atomic Transfer Radical Polymerisation (ATRP)-provides an almost infinite range of materials that can be used for many of these gelling systems. For those that self-assemble into micelle systems that can gel, the upper and lower critical solution temperatures (UCST and LCST) are analogous to those for simpler dispersible polymers. However, the tuned hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance plus the introduction of additional pH-sensitivity and, for instance, thermochromic response, open the potential for coupled mechanisms to create complex drug targeting effects at the cellular level.","Gels (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2017,Jan
Effect and Mechanism of Encapsulation-Based Spores on Self-Healing Concrete at Different Curing Ages.,"It has become an intelligent and environmental protection method to repair concrete cracks based on microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). However, due to the high-alkali environment in concrete, even the microbial spores with strong alkali resistance find it difficult to survive for a long time, which affects the long-term self-healing effect of concrete cracks. In this paper, low-alkali sulfo-aluminate cement (SC) was used as a carrier to encapsulate spores, and the effects of the spore group and microbial group on the basic performances of concrete were studied. Then, the area repair ratio, water permeability, the repair ratio of anti-chloride ion penetration, and ultrasonic velocity were used to evaluate the self-healing efficiency of cracks, and the self-healing effects of two kinds of microbial self-healing agents on concrete cracks with different curing ages were further studied. Moreover, the growth, enzyme activity, and microbial morphologies of spores with and without encapsulation immersed in the simulated pore solution of cement-based materials at different times were studied to discuss the protective effect of the carrier on spores. Compared with the reference group, the results showed that the addition of two microbial self-healing agents would slightly affect the basic performances of concrete, but both were within the control range of concrete materials. For the early-age cracks, the two kinds of microbial self-healing agents could achieve a good self-healing effect, but for the later-age cracks, the concrete cracks of the microbial group could still be repaired well, while the self-healing effect of the spore group was greatly reduced. Moreover, the white precipitates generated at the crack mouth were all calcite CaCO<sub>3</sub>. In addition, the self-healing mechanism of different microbial self-healing agents on concrete cracks was discussed carefully. This study provides a new idea and method for the engineering application of microbial self-healing concrete.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Nov
Self-healing of early age cracks in cement-based materials by mineralization of carbonic anhydrase microorganism.,"This research investigated the self-healing potential of early age cracks in cement-based materials incorporating the bacteria which can produce carbonic anhydrase. Cement-based materials specimens were pre-cracked at the age of 7, 14, 28, 60 days to study the repair ability influenced by cracking time, the width of cracks were between 0.1 and 1.0 mm to study the healing rate influenced by width of cracks. The experimental results indicated that the bacteria showed excellent repairing ability to small cracks formed at early age of 7 days, cracks below 0.4 mm was almost completely closed. The repair effect reduced with the increasing of cracking age. Cracks width influenced self-healing effectiveness significantly. The transportation of CO2and Ca(2+) controlled the self-healing process. The computer simulation analyses revealed the self-healing process and mechanism of microbiologically precipitation induced by bacteria and the depth of precipitated CaCO3 could be predicted base on valid Ca(2+).",Frontiers in microbiology,eng,2015,No Data
Self-Healing Concrete as a Prospective Construction Material: A Review.,"Concrete is a material that is widely used in the construction market due to its availability and cost, although it is prone to fracture formation. Therefore, there has been a surge in interest in self-healing materials, particularly self-healing capabilities in green and sustainable concrete materials, with a focus on different techniques offered by dozens of researchers worldwide in the last two decades. However, it is difficult to choose the most effective approach because each research institute employs its own test techniques to assess healing efficiency. Self-healing concrete (SHC) has the capacity to heal and lowers the requirement to locate and repair internal damage (e.g., cracks) without the need for external intervention. This limits reinforcement corrosion and concrete deterioration, as well as lowering costs and increasing durability. Given the merits of SHCs, this article presents a thorough review on the subject, considering the strategies, influential factors, mechanisms, and efficiency of self-healing. This literature review also provides critical synopses on the properties, performance, and evaluation of the self-healing efficiency of SHC composites. In addition, we review trends of development in research toward a broad understanding of the potential application of SHC as a superior concrete candidate and a turning point for developing sustainable and durable concrete composites for modern construction today. Further, it can be imagined that SHC will enable builders to construct buildings without fear of damage or extensive maintenance. Based on this comprehensive review, it is evident that SHC is a truly interdisciplinary hotspot research topic integrating chemistry, microbiology, civil engineering, material science, etc. Furthermore, limitations and future prospects of SHC, as well as the hotspot research topics for future investigations, are also successfully highlighted.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Apr
Advances in multifunctional chitosan-based self-healing hydrogels for biomedical applications.,"Multifunctional self-healing hydrogels have recently attracted considerable interest in biomedical applications owing to their diverse properties, including self-healing, adhesion, conduction, antibacterial, and stimulus-response, which can meet various application requirements, ranging from wound dressings and delivery vehicles to the production of scaffolds for tissue repair and regeneration. As a natural polycationic polysaccharide with good biocompatibility, chitosan is widely used in hydrogel formation as there are many amino and hydroxyl groups along the chains that can actively participate in various physical effects and chemical reactions, which enable it to construct self-healing hydrogels and fulfill multiple functions. In this review, the formation of chitosan-based self-healing hydrogels and the related self-healing mechanism are summarized, including Schiff base, metal coordination, ionic and hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic and host-guest interactions, with a focus on the strategies for their multi-functionalization. In the last section, the applications of the chitosan-based self-healing hydrogels in the fields of wound dressings, delivery vehicles, scaffolds, and biological sensors are discussed. Overall, it is highly expected that this review could provide an insight into the prospective development of multifunctional self-healing hydrogels for biomedical applications.",Journal of materials chemistry.

Construction and mechanism study of lignin-based polyurethane with high strength and high self-healing properties.,"Lignin is a natural polymer with abundant functional groups with great application prospects in lignin-based polyurethane elastomers with self-healing abilities. In this study, a lignin self-healing polyurethane (PUDA-L) was specially designed using lignin as the raw material of polyurethane, combining lignin with Diels-Alder (DA) bond and hydrogen bonds. The experimental results showed that PUDA-L was prepared with good thermal stability, fatigue resistance, shape memory effect, excellent mechanical strength, and self-healing ability by partially replacing the crosslinking agents with bio-based lignin and hydroxylated modified lignin to increase the hydroxyl content. Polyurethane has a tensile strength of up to 29 MPa and an elongation at break of up to 500 %. The excellent self-healing ability of PUDA-L originates from the internal DA bonds and cross-linked hydrogen bonds. After the dumbbell sample was fused and heated at 130 °C for 4 h, the elastomer could be completely healed, the tensile strength was restored to 29 MPa, and the self-healing efficiency was up to 100 %. The developed PUDA-L elastomer has promising applications in sensors and smart skins.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2023,Sep
Recent development and biomedical applications of self-healing hydrogels.,"Hydrogels are of special importance, owing to their high-water content and various applications in biomedical and bio-engineering research. Self-healing properties is a common phenomenon in living organisms. Their endowed property of being able to self-repair after physical/chemical/mechanical damage to fully or partially its original properties demonstrates their prospective therapeutic applications. Due to complicated preparation and selection of suitable materials, the application of many host-guest supramolecular polymeric hydrogels are so limited. Thus, the design and construction of self-repairing material are highly desirable for effectively increase in the lifetime of a functional material. However, recent advances in the field of materials science and bioengineering and nanotechnology have led to the design of biologically relevant self-healing hydrogels for therapeutic applications. This review focuses on the recent development of self-healing hydrogels for biomedical application.",Expert opinion on drug delivery,eng,2018,Jan
<i>In situ</i> self-assembly of polydopamine inside injectable hydrogels: antibacterial activity and photothermal therapy for superbug-infected wound healing.,"Inspired by the mussel foot proteins, polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs) are often used to design hydrogel wound dressings due to their strong wet adhesion. However, additional antibiotics or nanometal bactericides are always required to enhance their poor antibacterial activity, which will cause drug resistance and toxic side effects. Herein, self-assembly confined PDA NPs (SC-PDA NPs, <50 nm) are employed as a freestanding antibacterial ingredient for constructing an ideal hydrogel wound dressing, which maintains relatively strong reducibility and size effect. Through a rapid gelation (within 10 s) strategy triggered by electrostatic complexation, an antibacterial hydrogel system is obtained, in which the <i>in situ</i> self-assembly of the SC-PDA NPs continues, endowing the gel with outstanding antibacterial activity, especially against methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA, >99.9%). With the continuous <i>in situ</i> self-assembly, the size of the PDA NPs increases (>200 nm), eventually giving the gel an efficient photothermal therapy effect. Moreover, the gel presents a relatively strong wet adhesion (63 kPa), superior biocompatibility and non-immunogenicity. This work offers innovative insights into the antibacterial mechanism of SC-PDA NPs and provides a novel design for constructing safe antibacterial hydrogel wound dressings, demonstrating great potential applications in superbug-infected wound healing.",Biomaterials science,eng,2022,Jul
Toward Self-Healing Concrete Infrastructure: Review of Experiments and Simulations across Scales.,"Cement and concrete are vital materials used to construct durable habitats and infrastructure that withstand natural and human-caused disasters. Still, concrete cracking imposes enormous repair costs on societies, and excessive cement consumption for repairs contributes to climate change. Therefore, the need for more durable cementitious materials, such as those with self-healing capabilities, has become more urgent. In this review, we present the functioning mechanisms of five different strategies for implementing self-healing capability into cement based materials: (1) autogenous self-healing from ordinary portland cement and supplementary cementitious materials and geopolymers in which defects and cracks are repaired through intrinsic carbonation and crystallization; (2) autonomous self-healing by (a) biomineralization wherein bacteria within the cement produce carbonates, silicates, or phosphates to heal damage, (b) polymer-cement composites in which autonomous self-healing occurs both within the polymer and at the polymer-cement interface, and (c) fibers that inhibit crack propagation, thus allowing autogenous healing mechanisms to be more effective. In all cases, we discuss the self-healing agent and synthesize the state of knowledge on the self-healing mechanism(s). In this review article, the state of computational modeling across nano- to macroscales developed based on experimental data is presented for each self-healing approach. We conclude the review by noting that, although autogenous reactions help repair small cracks, the most fruitful opportunities lay within design strategies for additional components that can migrate into cracks and initiate chemistries that retard crack propagation and generate repair of the cement matrix.",Chemical reviews,eng,2023,Sep
A Review on Cementitious Self-Healing and the Potential of Phase-Field Methods for Modeling Crack-Closing and Fracture Recovery.,"Improving the durability and sustainability of concrete structures has been driving the enormous number of research papers on self-healing mechanisms that have been published in the past decades. The vast developments of computer science significantly contributed to this and enhanced the various possibilities numerical simulations can offer to predict the entire service life, with emphasis on crack development and cementitious self-healing. The aim of this paper is to review the currently available literature on numerical methods for cementitious self-healing and fracture development using Phase-Field (PF) methods. The PF method is a computational method that has been frequently used for modeling and predicting the evolution of meso- and microstructural morphology of cementitious materials. It uses a set of conservative and non-conservative field variables to describe the phase evolutions. Unlike traditional sharp interface models, these field variables are continuous in the interfacial region, which is typical for PF methods. The present study first summarizes the various principles of self-healing mechanisms for cementitious materials, followed by the application of PF methods for simulating microscopic phase transformations. Then, a review on the various PF approaches for precipitation reaction and fracture mechanisms is reported, where the final section addresses potential key issues that may be considered in future developments of self-healing models. This also includes unified, combined and coupled multi-field models, which allow a comprehensive simulation of self-healing processes in cementitious materials.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Nov
Analyzing the Mechanism of Functional Groups in Phosphate Additives on the Interface of LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.15</sub>Al<sub>0.05</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Cathode Materials.,"The design of a functional electrolyte system that is compatible with the LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.15</sub>Al<sub>0.05</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (LNCA) cathode is of great importance for advanced lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, chelated lithium salts of lithium difluoro(bisoxalato) phosphate (LiDFBOP) and lithium tetrafluoro(oxalate) phosphate (LTFOP) are synthesized by a facile and general method. Then, the complexes of LiDFBOP, LTFOP, and lithium difluorophosphate (LiDFP), all of which have a central phosphorus atom, were selected as the salt-type additives for the LiPF<sub>6</sub>-based electrolyte to improve the electrochemical performances of LNCA/Li half-batteries, respectively. The results of electrochemical tests, quantum chemistry calculations, potential-resolved <i>in situ</i> electrochemical impedance (PRIs-EIS) measurements, and surface analyses show that the interface property and the battery performance are closely associated with molecular structures of phosphorus-centered complex additives. It indicates that LiDFP with the P═O bond can significantly reduce the interfacial impedance of LNCA/Li half-batteries due to the increase of Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and the decrease of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI). While in LiDFBOP, according to the calculated vertical ionization potential (VIP), the two oxalate-chelated ligands bring about a bidirectional cross-linking reaction, which makes it preferential to be oxidized. This process is self-healing and can form a dense and stretched CEI, which is favorable to the cycle performance at the late stage. In contrast, the polymerization reaction will occur in one direction for LTFOP due to its lone oxalate ligand. Additionally, an unfavorable side reaction between LTFOP and EC has been proposed by the aid of Gibbs free energy calculation. This is a good explanation for the formation of the uneven and unstable CEI, as well as the continuous decomposition of the electrolyte in PRIs-EIS measurement. This work has an extensive applicability and practical significance not only for molecular designing of novel lithium salts, but also for the construction of a functional electrolyte system that is compatible with different electrode materials.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Apr
Recycling industrial wastes into self-healing concrete: A review.,"Self-healing concrete is an innovative construction material designed to repair its cracks autogenously or autonomously. The self-healing effect reduces the need for maintenance and increases the longevity of concrete structures, bringing environmental and economic benefits. However, the developed methods to improve self-healing performance, e.g., incorporating advanced techniques or expensive chemical healing agents, significantly increase the cost of concrete manufacture. There is worldwide interest in using waste materials to reduce the cost of self-healing concrete, and a significant amount of studies have been performed on this topic. A review of research on waste-derived self-healing concrete is presented in this paper. The wastes were used in both autogenous and autonomous self-healing approaches, such as mineral admixture, bacteria-based technology, and engineered cementitious composite; different environmental conditions may significantly influence self-healing efficiency due to different reaction mechanisms. In general, waste materials could be reused to manufacture self-healing concrete if adopting appropriate mix design and treatment methods. Self-healing concrete made with various industrial wastes is an efficient way to reduce the manufacturing cost and promote its application in practice.",Environmental research,eng,2022,Nov
Review on Carbonation Study of Reinforcement Concrete Incorporating with Bacteria as Self-Healing Approach.,"This study carried out a comprehensive review to determine the carbonation process that causes the most deterioration and destruction of concrete. The carbonation mechanism involved using carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to penetrate the concrete pore system into the atmosphere and reduce the alkalinity by decreasing the pH level around the reinforcement and initiation of the corrosion process. The use of bacteria in the concrete was to increase the pH of the concrete by producing urease enzyme. This technique may help to maintain concrete alkalinity in high levels, even when the carbonation process occurs, because the CO<sub>2</sub> accelerates to the concrete and then converts directly to calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Consequently, the self-healing of the cracks and the pores occurred as a result of the carbonation process and bacteria enzyme reaction. As a result of these reactions, the concrete steel is protected, and the concrete properties and durability may improve. However, there are several factors that control carbonation which have been grouped into internal and external factors. Many studies on carbonation have been carried out to explore the effect of bacteria to improve durability and concrete strength. However, an in-depth literature review revealed that the use of bacteria as a self-healing mechanism can still be improved upon. This review aimed to highlight and discuss the possibility of applying bacteria in concrete to improve reinforcement concrete.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Aug
The artificial leaf.,"To convert the energy of sunlight into chemical energy, the leaf splits water via the photosynthetic process to produce molecular oxygen and hydrogen, which is in a form of separated protons and electrons. The primary steps of natural photosynthesis involve the absorption of sunlight and its conversion into spatially separated electron-hole pairs. The holes of this wireless current are captured by the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) to oxidize water to oxygen. The electrons and protons produced as a byproduct of the OEC reaction are captured by ferrodoxin of photosystem I. With the aid of ferrodoxin-NADP(+) reductase, they are used to produce hydrogen in the form of NADPH. For a synthetic material to realize the solar energy conversion function of the leaf, the light-absorbing material must capture a solar photon to generate a wireless current that is harnessed by catalysts, which drive the four electron/hole fuel-forming water-splitting reaction under benign conditions and under 1 sun (100 mW/cm(2)) illumination. This Account describes the construction of an artificial leaf comprising earth-abundant elements by interfacing a triple junction, amorphous silicon photovoltaic with hydrogen- and oxygen-evolving catalysts made from a ternary alloy (NiMoZn) and a cobalt-phosphate cluster (Co-OEC), respectively. The latter captures the structural and functional attributes of the PSII-OEC. Similar to the PSII-OEC, the Co-OEC self-assembles upon oxidation of an earth-abundant metal ion from 2+ to 3+, may operate in natural water at room temperature, and is self-healing. The Co-OEC also activates H(2)O by a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism in which the Co-OEC is increased by four hole equivalents akin to the S-state pumping of the Kok cycle of PSII. X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies have established that the Co-OEC is a structural relative of Mn(3)CaO(4)-Mn cubane of the PSII-OEC, where Co replaces Mn and the cubane is extended in a corner-sharing, head-to-tail dimer. The ability to perform the oxygen-evolving reaction in water at neutral or near-neutral conditions has several consequences for the construction of the artificial leaf. The NiMoZn alloy may be used in place of Pt to generate hydrogen. To stabilize silicon in water, its surface is coated with a conducting metal oxide onto which the Co-OEC may be deposited. The net result is that immersing a triple-junction Si wafer coated with NiMoZn and Co-OEC in water and holding it up to sunlight can effect direct solar energy conversion via water splitting. By constructing a simple, stand-alone device composed of earth-abundant materials, the artificial leaf provides a means for an inexpensive and highly distributed solar-to-fuels system that employs low-cost systems engineering and manufacturing. Through this type of system, solar energy can become a viable energy supply to those in the non-legacy world.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2012,May
Dynamic covalent polymers enabled by reversible isocyanate chemistry.,"The design of responsive materials by introducing dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs), which can undergo reversible association and dissociation under certain conditions, is an appealing research field in recent years. Reversible isocyanate chemistry representatively consists of urethane, thiourethane, and urea bonds, all of which can reverse into their own starting chemicals (isocyanates and active hydrogen compounds) upon heating. In this article, we overview the mechanisms and experimental elements affecting the dynamic features of isocyanate-based bonds (IBs). With the knowledge of reversible isocyanate chemistry, the construction strategies of different dynamic covalent polymers including polyurethanes, polyureas, and polythiourethanes are discussed, in particular for dynamic polymer networks. The major applications of dynamic isocyanate-based polymers in recycling and self-healing materials, shape morphing polymers, 3D printing, and composites are outlined.

Rationally Constructed Surface Energy and Dynamic Hard Domains Balance Mechanical Strength and Self-Healing Efficiency of Energetic Linear Polymer Materials.,"Polymeric materials that simultaneously possess excellent mechanical properties and high self-healing ability at room temperature, convenient healing, and facile fabrication are always a huge challenge. Herein, we report on surface-energy-driven self-healing energetic linear polyurethane elastomers (EPU) that were facilely fabricated by two-step methods to acquire high healing efficiency and mechanical properties. By constructing surface energy and dynamic hard domains, energetic linear polyurethane elastomers not only obtained high healing ability and mechanical properties at high or room temperature but also avoid the use of some assisted healing conditions and complex chemical structure design and decrease manufacturing difficulty. Based on the interfacial healing physical model, various trends of surface tension, radius, and depth of the crack bottom were calculated to analyze the healing mechanism. We propose that polyurethane elastomers with low junction density could generate excess surface energy resulting from damage and drive self-healing, and incorporating a small amount of disulfide bonds increases the slightly packed hard phase and decreases the healing energy barrier. This work may offer a novel strategy for improving mechanical tensile and healing ability in the field of self-healing material application.",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,eng,2021,Aug

Polymeric Emissive Materials Based on Dynamic Covalent Bonds.,"Dynamic covalent polymers, composed of dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs), have received increasing attention in the last decade due to their adaptive and reversible nature compared with common covalent linked polymers. Incorporating the DCBs into the polymeric material endows it with advanced performance including self-healing, shape memory property, and so forth. However, the emissive ability of such dynamic covalent polymeric materials has been rarely reviewed. Herein, this review has summarized DCBs-based emissive polymeric materials which are classified according to the different types of DCBs, including imine bond, acylhydrazone bond, boronic ester bond, dynamic C-C bond, as well as the reversible bonds based on Diels-Alder reaction and transesterification. The mechanism of chemical reactions and various stimuli-responsive behaviors of DCBs are introduced, followed by typical emissive polymers resulting from these DCBs. By taking advantage of the reversible nature of DCBs under chemical/physical stimuli, the constructed emissive polymeric materials show controllable and switchable emission. Finally, challenges and future trends in this field are briefly discussed in this review.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Oct
[Research progress in spore-based in-situ restoration technology of concrete with microorganisms].,"Concrete is the most widely used modern building material. It is easy to crack under the action of stress, which makes the concrete structure permeable, affecting the durability and integrity of the structure, and thus shortening its service life. Microbial in-situ remediation technology is a low cost, effective and green way for concrete crack repairing. Due to its excellent biocompatibility, service life elongation, economic losses and environmental pollution reduction, microbial in-situ remediation technology has been intensively investigated. Bacillus has attracted much attention because of its excellent biomineralization ability, extremely strong environmental tolerance and long-term survival ability of its spores. In order to promote the research, development and large-scale application of microbial in-situ healing of concrete, the paper reviews the mechanism of spore-based in-situ healing of concrete, the survival of spores exposed in concrete, the influence of spores and external additives on the mechanical properties of concrete, progress in research and development of healing agent as well as healing effects. Moreover, future research focuses such as improving the survival ability of spores in the harsh environment of concrete, reducing the influence of external additives on the mechanical properties of concrete, and strengthening the healing effect of actual field applications are also summarized.",Sheng wu gong cheng xue bao = Chinese journal of biotechnology,chi,2021,Jul
Advanced self-healing asphalt composites in the pavement performance field: mechanisms at the nano level and new repairing methodologies.,"In an effort to give a global view of this field of research, in this mini-review we highlight the most recent publications and patents focusing on modified asphalt pavements that contain certain reinforcing nanoparticles which impart desirable thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. In response to the increasing cost of asphalt binder and road maintenance, there is a need to look for alternative technologies and new asphalt composites, able to self-repair, for preserving and renewing the existing pavements. First, we will focus on the self-healing property of asphalt, the evidences that support that healing takes place immediately after the contact between the faces of a crack, and how the amount of healing can be measured in both the laboratory and the field. Next we review the hypothetical mechanisms of healing to understand the material behaviour and establish models to quantify the damage-healing process.

Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as multifunctional nanoplatform for anticorrosion surfaces and coatings.,"Corrosion of metallic materials is a long-standing problem in many engineering fields. Various organic coatings have been widely applied in anticorrosion of metallic materials over the past decades. However, the protective performance of many organic coatings is limited due to the undesirable local failure of the coatings caused by micro-pores and cracks in the coating matrix. Recently, metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-based surfaces and coatings (MOFBSCs) have exhibited great potential in constructing protective materials on metallic substrates with efficient and durable anticorrosion performance. The tailorable porous structure, flexible composition, numerous active sites, and controllable release properties of MOFs make them an ideal platform for developing various protective functionalities, such as self-healing property, superhydrophobicity, and physical barrier against corrosion media. MOFs-based anticorrosion surfaces and coatings can be divided into two categories: the composite surfaces/coatings using MOFs-based passive/active nanofillers and the surfaces/coatings using MOFs as functional substrate support. In this work, the state-of-the-art fabrication strategies of the MOFBSCs are systematically reviewed. The anticorrosion mechanisms of MOFBSCs and functions of the MOFs in the coating matrix are discussed accordingly. Additionally, we highlight both traditional and emerging electrochemical techniques for probing protective performances and mechanisms of MOFBSCs.

Self-Healing Approach toward Catalytic Soft Robots.,"Soft robotics is a rapidly evolving research field that focuses on developing robots with bioinspired actuation/sensing mechanisms and highly flexible soft materials, some of which are similar to those found in living organisms. The hydrogel has the characteristics of excellent biocompatibility, softness, and elasticity, which makes it an ideal candidate material for the preparation of soft robots. Here we utilized a self-healing approach to develop a catalytically driven soft robot, which was constructed by dynamic imine bonds between modular hydrogels. One of the modules was a hydrogel formed by dynamic aldimine cross-linking of chitosan and glutaraldehyde, and the other module was a hydrogel embedded with catalase. The soft hydrogel robot moved because of catalytic reactions between the robot and environment [hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) fuel], giving rise to a fluidic release that supports propulsion, as inspired by the jet-propulsive mechanism in swimming dragonfly larvae. The speed of the soft robot can be mediated by adjusting the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and enable/disable movement based on the folding and unfolding of enzymes. In addition, the hydrogel formed by replacing glutaraldehyde with dialdehyde-functionalized PEG<sub>2000</sub> had excellent elastic properties, and the soft robot based on PEG<sub>2000</sub> had a higher movement speed than that based on glutaraldehyde under the same H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration. Moreover, the addition of iron oxide nanoparticles can realize the magnetic guidance of the soft robot and the combination of different modules can realize different motion modes. The highly configurable self-healing catalytic soft robot holds great potential for a variety of interesting applications, including swimming robots, robot-assisted water treatment, and drug release.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Sep
Construction of Processable Ultrastiff Hydrogel for Periarticular Fracture Strutting and Healing.,"Development of bioactive bone and joint implants that offer superior mechanical properties to facilitate personalized surgical procedures remains challenging in the field of biomedical materials. As for the hydrogel, mechanical property and processability are major obstructions hampering its application as load-bearing scaffolds in orthopedics. Herein, we constructed implantable composite hydrogels with appealing processability and ultrahigh stiffness. Central to our design is the incorporation of a thixotropic composite network into an elastic polymer network via dynamic interactions to synthesize a percolation-structured double-network (DN) hydrogel with plasticity, followed by in situ strengthening and self-strengthening mechanisms for fostering the DN structure to the cojoined-network structure and subsequently mineralized-composite-network structure to harvest excellent stiffness. The ultrastiff hydrogel is shapeable and can reach a compressive modulus of 80-200 MPa together with a fracture energy of 6-10 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>, comparable to the mechanical performance of cancellous bone. Moreover, the hydrogel is cytocompatible, osteogenic, and showed almost no volume shrinkage within 28 days in simulated body fluid or culture medium. Such characteristics enabled the utility of a hydrogel in the reduction and stabilization of periarticular fracture treatment on a distal femoral AO/OTA B1 fracture rabbit model and successfully avoided the recollapse of the articular surface.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2023,May
Engineered Nanotechnology: An Effective Therapeutic Platform for the Chronic Cutaneous Wound.,"The healing of chronic wound infections, especially cutaneous wounds, involves a complex cascade of events demanding mutual interaction between immunity and other natural host processes. Wound infections are caused by the consortia of microbial species that keep on proliferating and produce various types of virulence factors that cause the development of chronic infections. The mono- or polymicrobial nature of surface wound infections is best characterized by its ability to form biofilm that renders antimicrobial resistance to commonly administered drugs due to poor biofilm matrix permeability. With an increasing incidence of chronic wound biofilm infections, there is an urgent need for non-conventional antimicrobial approaches, such as developing nanomaterials that have intrinsic antimicrobial-antibiofilm properties modulating the biochemical or biophysical parameters in the wound microenvironment in order to cause disruption and removal of biofilms, such as designing nanomaterials as efficient drug-delivery vehicles carrying antibiotics, bioactive compounds, growth factor antioxidants or stem cells reaching the infection sites and having a distinct mechanism of action in comparison to antibiotics-functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) for better incursion through the biofilm matrix. NPs are thought to act by modulating the microbial colonization and biofilm formation in wounds due to their differential particle size, shape, surface charge and composition through alterations in bacterial cell membrane composition, as well as their conductivity, loss of respiratory activity, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrosation of cysteines of proteins, lipid peroxidation, DNA unwinding and modulation of metabolic pathways. For the treatment of chronic wounds, extensive research is ongoing to explore a variety of nanoplatforms, including metallic and nonmetallic NPs, nanofibers and self-accumulating nanocarriers. As the use of the magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-entrenched pre-designed hydrogel sheet (MPS) is found to enhance wound healing, the bio-nanocomposites consisting of bacterial cellulose and magnetic nanoparticles (magnetite) are now successfully used for the healing of chronic wounds. With the objective of precise targeting, some kinds of ""intelligent"" nanoparticles are constructed to react according to the required environment, which are later incorporated in the dressings, so that the wound can be treated with nano-impregnated dressing material in situ. For the effective healing of skin wounds, high-expressing, transiently modified stem cells, controlled by nano 3D architectures, have been developed to encourage angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. In order to overcome the challenge of time and dose constraints during drug administration, the approach of combinatorial nano therapy is adopted, whereby AI will help to exploit the full potential of nanomedicine to treat chronic wounds.","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Feb
"Oxide Cathodes: Functions, Instabilities, Self Healing, and Degradation Mitigations.","Recent progress in high-energy-density oxide cathodes for lithium-ion batteries has pushed the limits of lithium usage and accessible redox couples. It often invokes hybrid anion- and cation-redox (HACR), with exotic valence states such as oxidized oxygen ions under high voltages. Electrochemical cycling under such extreme conditions over an extended period can trigger various forms of chemical, electrochemical, mechanical, and microstructural degradations, which shorten the battery life and cause safety issues. Mitigation strategies require an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here we offer a systematic overview of the functions, instabilities, and peculiar materials behaviors of the oxide cathodes. We note unusual anion and cation mobilities caused by high-voltage charging and exotic valences. It explains the extensive lattice reconstructions at room temperature in both good (plasticity and self-healing) and bad (phase change, corrosion, and damage) senses, with intriguing electrochemomechanical coupling. The insights are critical to the understanding of the unusual self-healing phenomena in ceramics (e.g., grain boundary sliding and lattice microcrack healing) and to novel cathode designs and degradation mitigations (e.g., suppressing stress-corrosion cracking and constructing reactively wetted cathode coating). Such mixed ionic-electronic conducting, electrochemically active oxides can be thought of as almost ""metalized"" if at voltages far from the open-circuit voltage, thus differing significantly from the highly insulating ionic materials in electronic transport and mechanical behaviors. These characteristics should be better understood and exploited for high-performance energy storage, electrocatalysis, and other emerging applications.",Chemical reviews,eng,2023,Jan
Current challenges and future directions for bacterial self-healing concrete.,"Microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) has been widely explored and applied in the field of environmental engineering over the last decade. Calcium carbonate is naturally precipitated as a byproduct of various microbial metabolic activities. This biological process was brought into practical use to restore construction materials, strengthen and remediate soil, and sequester carbon. MICP has also been extensively examined for applications in self-healing concrete. Biogenic crack repair helps mitigate the high maintenance costs of concrete in an eco-friendly manner. In this process, calcium carbonate precipitation (CCP)-capable bacteria and nutrients are embedded inside the concrete. These bacteria are expected to increase the durability of the concrete by precipitating calcium carbonate in situ to heal cracks that develop in the concrete. However, several challenges exist with respect to embedding such bacteria; harsh conditions in concrete matrices are unsuitable for bacterial life, including high alkalinity (pH up to 13), high temperatures during manufacturing processes, and limited oxygen supply. Additionally, many biological factors, including the optimum conditions for MICP, the molecular mechanisms involved in MICP, the specific microorganisms suitable for application in concrete, the survival characteristics of the microorganisms embedded in concrete, and the amount of MICP in concrete, remain unclear. In this paper, metabolic pathways that result in conditions favorable for calcium carbonate precipitation, current and potential applications in concrete, and the remaining biological challenges are reviewed.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2018,Apr
Immobilized bacteria with pH-response hydrogel for self-healing of concrete.,"Concrete is significant for construction. A problem in application is the appearance of cracks that will damage its strength. An autogenous crack-healing mechanism based on bacteria receives increasing attention in recent years. The bacteria are able to form calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) precipitations in suitable conditions to protect and reinforce the concrete. However, a large number of spores are crushed in aged specimens, resulting in a loss of viability. A new kind of hydrogel crosslinked by alginate, chitosan and calcium ions was introduced in this study. It was observed that the addition of chitosan improved the swelling properties of calcium alginate. Opposite pH response to calcium alginate was observed when the chitosan content in the solution reached 1.0%. With an addition of 1.0% chitosan in hydrogel beads, 10.28% increase of compressive strength and 13.79% increase of flexural strength to the control were observed. The results reveal self-healing properties of concretes. A healing crack of 4 cm length and 1 mm width was observed when using cement PO325, with the addition of bacterial spores (2.54-3.07 × 10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> concrete) encapsulated by hydrogel containing no chitosan.",Journal of environmental management,eng,2020,May
Development of a self-healing soft pneumatic actuator: a first concept.,"Inspired by the intrinsic softness and the corresponding embodied intelligence principles, soft pneumatic actuators (SPA) have been developed, which ensure safe interaction in unstructured, unknown environments. Due to their intrinsic softness, these actuators have the ability to resist large mechanical impacts. However, the soft materials used in these structures are in general susceptible to damage caused by sharp objects found in the unstructured environments. This paper proposes to integrate a self-healing (SH-) mechanism in SPAs, such that cuts, tears and perforations in the actuator can be self-healed. Diels-Alder (DA-) polymers, covalent polymer network systems based on the thermoreversible DA-reaction, were selected and their mechanical, as well as SH-properties, are described. To evaluate the feasibility of developing an SPA constructed out of SH-material, a single cell prototype, a SH-soft pneumatic cell (SH-SPC), was constructed entirely out of DA-polymers. Exploiting the SH-property of the DA-polymers, a completely new shaping process is presented in this paper, referred to as 'shaping through folding and self-healing'. 3D polygon structures, like the cubic SH-SPC, can be constructed by folding SH-polymer sheet. The sides of the structures can be sealed and made airtight using a SH-procedure at relatively low temperatures (<90 °C). Both the (thermo) mechanical and SH-properties of the SH-SPC prototype were experimentally validated and showed excellent performances. Macroscopic incisions in the prototype were completely healed using a SH-procedure (<70 °C). Starting from this single-cell prototype, it is straight-forward to develop a multi-cell prototype, the first SPA ever built completely out of SH-polymers.",Bioinspiration & biomimetics,eng,2015,Jul
Detecting the activation of a self-healing mechanism in concrete by acoustic emission and digital image correlation.,"Autonomous crack healing in concrete is obtained when encapsulated healing agent is embedded into the material. Cracking damage in concrete elements ruptures the capsules and activates the healing process by healing agent release. Previously, the strength and stiffness recovery as well as the sealing efficiency after autonomous crack repair was well established. However, the mechanisms that trigger capsule breakage remain unknown. In parallel, the conditions under which the crack interacts with embedded capsules stay black-box. In this research, an experimental approach implementing an advanced optical and acoustic method sets up scopes to monitor and justify the crack formation and capsule breakage of concrete samples tested under three-point bending. Digital Image Correlation was used to visualize the crack opening. The optical information was the basis for an extensive and analytical study of the damage by Acoustic Emission analysis. The influence of embedding capsules on the concrete fracture process, the location of capsule damage, and the differentiation between emissions due to capsule rupture and crack formation are presented in this research. A profound observation of the capsules performance provides a clear view of the healing activation process.",TheScientificWorldJournal,eng,2013,No Data
The Horizon of Materiobiology: A Perspective on Material-Guided Cell Behaviors and Tissue Engineering.,"Although the biological functions of cell and tissue can be regulated by biochemical factors (e.g., growth factors, hormones), the biophysical effects of materials on the regulation of biological activity are receiving more attention. In this Review, we systematically summarize the recent progress on how biomaterials with controllable properties (e.g., compositional/degradable dynamics, mechanical properties, 2D topography, and 3D geometry) can regulate cell behaviors (e.g., cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, cell alignment, and the differentiation or self-maintenance of stem cells) and tissue/organ functions. How the biophysical features of materials influence tissue/organ regeneration have been elucidated. Current challenges and a perspective on the development of novel materials that can modulate specific biological functions are discussed. The interdependent relationship between biomaterials and biology leads us to propose the concept of ""materiobiology"", which is a scientific discipline that studies the biological effects of the properties of biomaterials on biological functions at cell, tissue, organ, and the whole organism levels. This Review highlights that it is more important to develop ECM-mimicking biomaterials having a self-regenerative capacity to stimulate tissue regeneration, instead of attempting to recreate the complexity of living tissues or tissue constructs ex vivo. The principles of materiobiology may benefit the development of novel biomaterials providing combinative bioactive cues to activate the migration of stem cells from endogenous reservoirs (i.e., cell niches), stimulate robust and scalable self-healing mechanisms, and unlock the body's innate powers of regeneration.",Chemical reviews,eng,2017,Mar
Molecular interaction mechanisms of glycol chitosan self-healing hydrogel as a drug delivery system for gemcitabine and doxorubicin.,"Glycol chitosan is a derivative of chitosan that has attracted attention in recent years due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Due to its unique biological characteristics, it has been widely used in hydrogels and biomaterials. In this study, we explored the loading efficiency of a self-healing hydrogel (GC-DP) comprising glycol chitosan (GC) and telechelic difunctional poly(ethylene glycol) (DF-PEG) for delivering the anticancer drugs gemcitabine and doxorubicin through full atomistic simulations. We also constructed full atomistic models of the two drug delivery systems at three drug concentrations of 10%, 40%, and 80% to understand how the drug concentration affects the loading efficiency and molecular structure of the GC-DP hydrogels. Through the analysis of the results, we show that the GC-DP hydrogel exhibits excellent loading efficiency for both gemcitabine and doxorubicin at all drug concentrations (10%, 40% and 80%). Our results reveal that the main mechanism of interaction between the GC-DP hydrogels and gemcitabine is van der Waals adsorption and that the dominant interactions between the GC-DP hydrogel and doxorubicin are hydrogen bonds for the D10 model and van der Waals adsorption for the D40 and D80 models. Our results provide molecular insights into how drug molecules are carried by hydrogel materials and indicate that the GC-DP hydrogel is a promising candidate for carrying both gemcitabine and doxorubicin, and thus serving as a novel drug carrier for cancer treatment.",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,eng,2022,No Data
Recent advances in eco-friendly fabrics with special wettability for oil/water separation.,"Considering the serious damage to aquatic ecosystems and marine life caused by oil spills and oily wastewater discharge, efficient, environment-friendly and sustainable oil/water separation technology has become an inevitable trend for current development. Herein, fabrics are recognized as eco-friendly materials for water treatment due to their good degradability and low cost. Particularly, fabrics with rough structures and natural hydrophilicity/oleophilicity enable the construction of superwetting surfaces for the selective separation of oil/water mixtures and even complex emulsions. Therefore, superwetting fabrics for efficiently solving oil spills and purifying oily wastewater have received extensive attention. Especially, Janus and smart fabrics are highly anticipated to enable the on-demand and sustainable treatment of oil spills and oily wastewater due to their changeable wettability. Moreover, the fabrication of superwetting fabrics with multifunctional performances for oily wastewater purification can further promote their practical industrial applications, such as photocatalytic, self-cleaning, and self-healing characteristics. However, some potential challenges still exist, which urgently need to be systematically summarized to guide the future development of this research field. In this review, firstly, the fundamental theories of wettability and the separation mechanisms based on special wettability are discussed. Then, superwetting fabrics for efficient oil/water separation are systematically reviewed, such as superhydrophobic/superoleophilic (SHB/SOL), superhydrophilic/superoleophobic (SHL/SOB), SHL/underwater superoleophobic (SHL/UWSOB), and UWSOB/underoil superoleophobic (UWSOB/UOSHB) fabrics. Most importantly, we highlight Janus, smart, and multifunctional fabrics based on their superwetting property. Correspondingly, the advantages and disadvantages of each superwetting fabric are comprehensively analyzed. Besides, super-antiwetting fabrics with superhydrophobic/superoleophobic (SHB/SOB) property are also introduced.

A Review of Smart Lubricant-Infused Surfaces for Droplet Manipulation.,"The nepenthes-inspired lubricant-infused surface (LIS) is emerging as a novel repellent surface with self-healing, self-cleaning, pressure stability and ultra-slippery properties. Recently, stimuli-responsive materials to construct a smart LIS have broadened the application of LIS for droplet manipulation, showing great promise in microfluidics. This review mainly focuses on the recent developments towards the droplet manipulation on LIS with different mechanisms induced by various external stimuli, including thermo, light, electric, magnetism, and mechanical force. First, the droplet condition on LIS, determined by the properties of the droplet, the lubricant and substrate, is illustrated. Droplet manipulation via altering the droplet regime realized by different mechanisms, such as varying slipperiness, electrostatic force and wettability, is discussed. Moreover, some applications on droplet manipulation employed in various filed, including microreactors, microfluidics, etc., are also presented. Finally, a summary of this work and possible future research directions for the transport of droplets on smart LIS are outlined to promote the development of this field.","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Mar
Zwitterionic fusion in hydrogels and spontaneous and time-independent self-healing under physiological conditions.,"The biomedical applications of current self-healing materials are largely impeded by their healing conditions, which usually require heating, UV exposure or harsh pH environments. At the same time, for very few existing spontaneously self-healing materials, healing can only be achieved immediately after rupture occurs. Here, we developed a spontaneously healing material, driven by a new mechanism, ""zwitterionic fusion"", which is repairable independent of time after damage under physiological conditions. We also tested the anti-fatigue property of this zwitterionic hydrogel. Furthermore, we utilized this zwitterionic fusion to link different cell-hydrogel constructs together.",Biomaterials,eng,2014,Apr
An in situ and rapid self-healing strategy enabling a stretchable nanocomposite with extremely durable and highly sensitive sensing features.,"Progress toward the development of wearable electromechanical sensors with durable and reliable sensing performance is critical for emerging wearable integrated electronic applications. However, it remains a long-standing challenge to realize mechanically stretchable sensing materials with extremely durable and high-performing sensing ability due to the fundamental dilemma lying in the sensing mechanism. In this work, we proposed an in situ and rapid self-healing strategy through nano-confining a dynamic host-guest supramolecular polymer network in a graphene-based multilevel nanocomposite matrix to fabricate a mechanically stretchable and structurally healable sensing nanocomposite which is provided with intriguing sensing durability and sensitivity simultaneously. When repeatedly stretching and releasing the nanocomposite sensing film, the fast association kinetics of cyclodextrin and adamantane host-guest inclusion complexes and good polymer chain dynamics in the supramolecular polymer network endowed by the nanoconfinement effect enable autonomous and rapid repair of the micro-cracks in situ generated in the sensing material. As a result, our strain sensing devices can achieve an extremely high durability and retain stable sensing performance even after over 100 000 stretching-releasing cycles at large strain of 50%. Moreover, the brittle nature originated from the inorganically dominated structure in conjunction with the thermodynamically stable host-guest interactions and dynamic hydrogen bonds inside the multilevel nanocomposite allow the sensing material to exhibit an ultrahigh gauge factor over 1500 with a large working strain of 58%. This work presents a reliable approach for the construction of ultradurable and high-performing wearable electronics.",Materials horizons,eng,2021,Jan
Constructive adaptation of 3D-printable polymers in response to typically destructive aquatic environments.,"In response to environmental stressors, biological systems exhibit extraordinary adaptive capacity by turning destructive environmental stressors into constructive factors; however, the traditional engineering materials weaken and fail. Take the response of polymers to an aquatic environment as an example: Water molecules typically compromise the mechanical properties of the polymer network in the bulk and on the interface through swelling and lubrication, respectively. Here, we report a class of 3D-printable synthetic polymers that constructively strengthen their bulk and interfacial mechanical properties in response to the aquatic environment. The mechanism relies on a water-assisted additional cross-linking reaction in the polymer matrix and on the interface. As such, the typically destructive water can constructively enhance the polymer's bulk mechanical properties such as stiffness, tensile strength, and fracture toughness by factors of 746% to 790%, and the interfacial bonding by a factor of 1,000%. We show that the invented polymers can be used for soft robotics that self-strengthen matrix and self-heal cracks after training in water and water-healable packaging materials for flexible electronics. This work opens the door for the design of synthetic materials to imitate the constructive adaptation of biological systems in response to environmental stressors, for applications such as artificial muscles, soft robotics, and flexible electronics.",PNAS nexus,eng,2022,Jul
A Bioinspired Self-Healing Conductive Hydrogel Promoting Peripheral Nerve Regeneration.,"The development of self-healing conductive hydrogels is critical in electroactive nerve tissue engineering. Typical conductive materials such as polypyrrole (PPy) are commonly used to fabricate artificial nerve conduits. Moreover, the field of tissue engineering has advanced toward the use of products such as hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels. Although HA-modified PPy films are prepared for various biological applications, the cell-matrix interaction mechanisms remain poorly understood; furthermore, there are no reports on HA-modified PPy-injectable self-healing hydrogels for peripheral nerve repair. Therefore, in this study, a self-healing electroconductive hydrogel (HASPy) from HA, cystamine (Cys), and pyrrole-1-propionic acid (Py-COOH), with injectability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and nerve-regenerative capacity is constructed. The hydrogel directly targets interleukin 17 receptor A (IL-17RA) and promotes the expression of genes and proteins relevant to Schwann cell myelination mainly by activating the interleukin 17 (IL-17) signaling pathway. The hydrogel is injected directly into the rat sciatic nerve-crush injury sites to investigate its capacity for nerve regeneration in vivo and is found to promote functional recovery and remyelination. This study may help in understanding the mechanism of cell-matrix interactions and provide new insights into the potential use of HASPy hydrogel as an advanced scaffold for neural regeneration.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",eng,2023,Aug
Self-Assembly of Silk-like Protein into Nanoscale Bicontinuous Networks under Phase-Separation Conditions.,"Liquid-liquid phase separation of biomacromolecules is crucial in various inter- and extracellular biological functions. This includes formation of condensates to control, e.g., biochemical reactions and structural assembly. The same phenomenon is also found to be critically important in protein-based high-performance biological materials. Here, we use a well-characterized model triblock protein system to demonstrate the molecular level formation mechanism and structure of its condensate. Large-scale molecular modeling supported by analytical ultracentrifuge characterization combined with our earlier high magnification precision cryo-SEM microscopy imaging leads to deducing that the condensate has a bicontinuous network structure. The bicontinuous network rises from the proteins having a combination of sites with stronger mutual attraction and multiple weakly attractive regions connected by flexible, multiconfigurational linker regions. These attractive sites and regions behave as stickers of varying adhesion strength. For the examined model triblock protein construct, the β-sheet-rich end units are the stronger stickers, while additional weaker stickers, contributing to the condensation affinity, rise from spring-like connections in the flexible middle region of the protein. The combination of stronger and weaker sticker-like connections and the flexible regions between the stickers result in a versatile, liquid-like, self-healing structure. This structure also explains the high flexibility, easy deformability, and diffusion of the proteins, decreasing only 10-100 times in the bicontinuous network formed in the condensate phase in comparison to dilute protein solution. The here demonstrated structure and condensation mechanism of a model triblock protein construct via a combination of the stronger binding regions and the weaker, flexible sacrificial-bond-like network as well as its generalizability via polymer sticker models provide means to not only understand intracellular organization, regulation, and cellular function but also to identify direct control factors for and to enable engineering improved protein and polymer constructs to enhance control of advanced fiber materials, smart liquid biointerfaces, or self-healing matrices for pharmaceutics or bioengineering materials.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2021,Feb
Controlling the calcium carbonate microstructure of engineered living building materials.,"The fabrication of responsive soft materials that enable the controlled release of microbial induced calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) precipitation (MICP) would be highly desirable for the creation of living materials that can be used, for example, as self-healing construction materials. To obtain a tight control over the mechanical properties of these materials, needed for civil engineering applications, the amount, location, and structure of the forming minerals must be precisely tuned; this requires good control over the dynamic functionality of bacteria. Despite recent advances in the self-healing of concrete cracks and the understanding of the role of synthesis conditions on the CaCO<sub>3</sub> polymorphic regulation, the degree of control over the CaCO<sub>3</sub> remains insufficient to meet these requirements. We demonstrate that the amount and location of CaCO<sub>3</sub> produced within a matrix, can be controlled through the concentration and location of bacteria; these parameters can be precisely tuned if bacteria are encapsulated, as we demonstrate with the soil-dwelling bacterium <i>Sporosarcina pasteurii</i> that is deposited within biocompatible alginate and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) hydrogels. Using a competitive ligand exchange mechanism that relies on the presence of yeast extract, we control the timing of the release of calcium ions that crosslink the alginate or CMC without compromising bacterial viability. With this novel use of hydrogel encapsulation of bacteria for on-demand release of MICP, we achieve control over the amount and structure of CaCO<sub>3</sub>-based composites and demonstrate that <i>S. pasteurii</i> can be stored for up to 3 months at an accessible storage temperature of 4 °C, which are two important factors that currently limit the applicability of MICP for the reinforcement of construction materials. These composites thus have the potential to sense, respond, and heal without the need for external intervention.",Journal of materials chemistry. A,eng,2021,Nov
Aspiration-assisted freeform bioprinting of prefabricated tissue spheroids in a yield-stress gel.,"Bioprinting of cellular aggregates, such as tissue spheroids, to form three-dimensional (3D) complex-shaped arrangements, has posed a major challenge due to lack of robust, reproducible and practical bioprinting techniques. Here, we demonstrate 3D aspiration-assisted freeform bioprinting of tissue spheroids by precisely positioning them in self-healing yield-stress gels, enabling the self-assembly of spheroids for fabrication of tissues. The presented approach enables the traverse of spheroids directly from the cell media to the gel and freeform positioning of the spheroids on demand. We study the underlying physical mechanism of the approach to elucidate the interactions between the aspirated spheroids and the gel's yield-stress during the transfer of spheroids from cell media to the gel. We further demonstrate the application of the proposed approach in the realization of various freeform shapes and self-assembly of human mesenchymal stem cell spheroids for the construction of cartilage and bone tissues.",Communications physics,eng,2020,No Data
Addressing thrombogenicity in vascular graft construction.,"Thrombosis is a major cause of poor patency in synthetic vascular grafts for small diameter vessel (< 6 mm) bypass. Arteries have a host of structural mechanisms by which they prevent triggering of platelet activation and the clotting cascade. Many of these are present in vascular endothelial cells. These mechanisms act together with perpetual feedback at different levels, providing a constantly fine-tuned non-thrombogenic environment. The arterial wall anatomy also serves to promote thrombosis as a healing mechanism when it has been severely injured. Surface modification of synthetic graft surfaces to attenuate the coagulation cascade has reduced thrombosis levels and improved patency in vitro and in animal models. Success in this endeavor is critically dependent on the methods used to modify the surface. Platelets adhere to positively charged surfaces due to their own negative charge. They also preferentially attach to hydrophobic surfaces. Therefore synthetic graft development is concerned with hydrophilic materials with negative surface charge. However, fibrinogen has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic binding sites-amphiphilic materials reduce its adhesion and subsequent platelet activation. The self-endothelializing synthetic graft is an attractive proposition as a confluent endothelial layer incorporates many of the anti-thrombogenic properties of arteries. Surface modification to promote this has shown good results in animal models. The difficulties experienced in achieving spontaneous endothelialisation in humans have lead to the investigation of pre-implantation in vitro endothelial cell seeding. These approaches ultimately aim to result in novel synthetic grafts which are anti-thrombogenic and hence suitable for coronary and distal infrainguinal bypass.","Journal of biomedical materials research.

Amine-modified magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle as a promising carrier for application in bio self-healing concrete.,"Self-healing mechanisms are a promising solution to address the concrete cracking issue. Among the investigated self-healing strategies, the biotechnological approach is distinguished itself by inducing the most compatible material with concrete composition. In this method, the potent bacteria and nutrients are incorporated into the concrete matrix. Once cracking occurs, the bacteria will be activated, and the induced CaCO<sub>3</sub> crystals will seal the concrete cracks. However, the effectiveness of a bio self-healing concrete strictly depends on the viability of bacteria. Therefore, it is required to protect the bacteria from the resulted shear forces caused by mixing and drying shrinkage of concrete. Due to the positive effects on mechanical properties and the high compatibility of metallic nanoparticles with concrete composition, for the first time, we propose 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (APTES-coated IONs) as a biocompatible carrier for Bacillus species. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of APTES-coated IONs on the bacterial viability and CaCO<sub>3</sub> yield for future application in the concrete structures. The APTES-coated IONs were successfully synthesized and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results show that the presence of 100 μg/mL APTES-coated IONs could increase the bacterial viability. It was also found that the CaCO<sub>3</sub>-specific yield was significantly affected in the presence of APTES-coated IONs. The highest CaCO<sub>3</sub>-specific yield was achieved when the cells were decorated with 50 μg/mL of APTES-coated IONs. This study provides new insights for the application of APTES-coated IONs in designing bio self-healing strategies.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2018,Jan
Hierarchical Assemblies of Supramolecular Coordination Complexes.,"Hierarchical self-assembly (HAS) is a multilevel organization process that first assembles elementary molecular units into ordered secondary structures via noncovalent interactions, which further act as the building blocks to form more complex multifunctional superstructures at the next level(s). The HAS strategy has been used as a versatile method for the preparation of soft-matter nanoarchitectures of defined size and morphologies, tunable luminescence, and biological importance. However, such preparation can be greatly simplified if well-defined dynamic structures are employed as the cores that upon linking form the desired nanoarchitectures. Discrete supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) with well-defined shapes, sizes, and internal cavities have been widely employed to construct hierarchical systems with functional diversity. This Account summarizes the prevailing strategies used in recent years in the preparation of SCC-based HASs and illustrates how the combination of dynamic metal-ligand coordination with other interactions was used to obtain hierarchical systems with interesting properties. HASs with dual orthogonal interactions involving coordination-driven self-assembly and hydrogen bonding/host-guest interaction generally result in robust and flexible supramolecular gels. Likewise, hybridization of SCCs with a suitable dynamic covalent network via a hierarchical strategy is useful to prepare materials with self-healing properties. The intrinsic positive charges of the SCCs also make them suitable precursors for the construction of HASs via electrostatic interactions with negatively charged biological/abiological molecules. Furthermore, the interplay between the hydrophilic and lipophilic characters of HASs by varying the number and spacial orientation of alkyl/oxyethylene chains of the SCC is a simple yet controllable approach to prepare ordered and tunable nanostructures. Certain SCC-cored hierarchical systems exhibit reversible polymorphism, typically between micellar, nanofiber, and vesicular phases, in response to various external perturbations: heat, photoirradiation, pH-variance, redox-active agents, etc. At the same time, multiple noncovalent interaction mediated HASs are growing in numbers and are promising candidates for obtaining functionally diverse materials. The photophysical properties of SCC-based HASs have been used in many analytical applications. For example, embedding tetraphenylethene (TPE)-based pyridyl ligands within metallo-supramolecular structures partially restricts the molecular rotations of its phenyl rings, endowing the resultant SCCs with weak emissions. Further aggregation of such HASs in suitable solvents results in a marked enhancement in emission intensity along with quantum yields. They act as sensitive sensors for different analytes, including pathogens, drugs, etc. HASs are also useful to develop multidrug systems with cooperative chemotherapeutic effects. Hence, the use of HASs with theranostic SCCs combining cell-imaging agents and chemotherapeutic scaffolds is a promising drug delivery strategy for cancer theranostics. At the same time, their responsiveness to stimuli, oftentimes due to the dynamic nature of the metal-ligand interactions, play an important role in drug release via a disassembly mechanism.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2018,Sep
In-Situ X-ray Tomography Study of Cement Exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> Saturated Brine.,"For successful CO<sub>2</sub> storage in underground reservoirs, the potential problem of CO<sub>2</sub> leakage needs to be addressed. A profoundly improved understanding of the behavior of fractured cement under realistic subsurface conditions including elevated temperature, high pressure and the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> saturated brine is required. Here, we report in situ X-ray micro computed tomography (μ-CT) studies visualizing the microstructural changes upon exposure of cured Portland cement with an artificially engineered leakage path (cavity) to CO<sub>2</sub> saturated brine at high pressure. Carbonation of the bulk cement, self-healing of the leakage path in the cement specimen, and leaching of CaCO<sub>3</sub> were thus directly observed. The precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, which is of key importance as a possible healing mechanism of fractured cement, was found to be enhanced in confined regions having limited access to CO<sub>2</sub>. For the first time, the growth kinetics of CaCO<sub>3</sub> under more realistic well conditions have thus been estimated quantitatively. Combining the μ-CT observations with scanning electron microscopy resulted in a detailed understanding of the processes involved in the carbonation of cement.",Environmental science & technology,eng,2017,Aug
Rational multivalency construction enables bactericidal effect amplification and dynamic biomaterial design.,"The multivalency of bioligands in living systems brings inspiration for not only the discovery of biological mechanisms but also the design of extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking biomaterials. However, designing controllable multivalency construction strategies is still challenging. Herein, we synthesized a series of well-defined multivalent antimicrobial peptide polymers (mAMPs) by clicking ligand molecules onto polymers prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The multiple cationic ligands in the mAMPs could enhance the local disturbance of the anionic phospholipid layer of the bacterial membrane through multivalent binding, leading to amplification of the bactericidal effect. In addition to multivalency-enhanced antibacterial activity, mAMPs also enable multivalency-assisted hydrogel fabrication with an ECM-like dynamic structure. The resultant hydrogel with self-healing and injectable properties could be successfully employed as an antibacterial biomaterial scaffold to treat infected skin wounds. The multivalency construction strategy presented in this work provides new ideas for the biomimetic design of highly active and dynamic biomaterials for tissue repair and regeneration.",Innovation (Cambridge (Mass.)),eng,2023,Sep
Recent Progress in Electronic Skin.,"The skin is the largest organ of the human body and can sense pressure, temperature, and other complex environmental stimuli or conditions. The mimicry of human skin's sensory ability via electronics is a topic of innovative research that could find broad applications in robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-machine interfaces, all of which promote the development of electronic skin (e-skin). To imitate tactile sensing via e-skins, flexible and stretchable pressure sensor arrays are constructed based on different transduction mechanisms and structural designs. These arrays can map pressure with high resolution and rapid response beyond that of human perception. Multi-modal force sensing, temperature, and humidity detection, as well as self-healing abilities are also exploited for multi-functional e-skins. Other recent progress in this field includes the integration with high-density flexible circuits for signal processing, the combination with wireless technology for convenient sensing and energy/data transfer, and the development of self-powered e-skins. Future opportunities lie in the fabrication of highly intelligent e-skins that can sense and respond to variations in the external environment. The rapidly increasing innovations in this area will be important to the scientific community and to the future of human life.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",eng,2015,Oct
Animal models for cartilage repair.,"Cartilage lesions still represent an unsolved problem: despite the efforts of the basic and translational research, the regeneration of this tissue is far from being reached (1-3). Articular cartilage lesions can be divided in two main groups: superficial or partial defects and full-thickness defects (4, 5). Partial lesions are not able to self-heal because multipotent cells from the bone marrow cannot reach the area leading to a progressive degeneration of the tissue (6). Conversely, full-thickness injuries possess greater chances to heal because subchondral bone involvement allows for the migration of mesenchymal cells, which fill the damaged area (7, 8). However, healing occurs through the formation of a fibrocartilaginous tissue, which has different biomechanical and biological properties (9). Native hyaline cartilage has indeed specific biomechanical properties, which confer resistance to compressive and shear stresses; the reparative fibrocartilaginous tissue lacks these abilities, therefore, the surrounding healthy cartilage progressively degenerates. In the past years, several therapeutic strategies have been developed to restore the damaged cartilage, bone marrow stimulation (chondroabrasion, drilling, micro- or nano-fractures) and more recently, tissue engineering approaches (10-14). Some of these latter procedures have already been applied in clinical practice such as matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) (15) or osteochondral scaffold implantation (16). Generally, tissue engineering approaches are based on the combination of three main elements: cells (i.e. primary chondrocytes or multipotent mesenchymal cells), biocompatible scaffolds (i.e. polymers, composites, ceramics) and signaling molecules (i.e. growth factors). Moreover, several culture conditions (i.e. static or dynamic cultures) and biomechanical stimuli can be applied during the <i>in vitro</i> culture to promote tissue maturation (17-19). However, an <i>in vivo</i> culture is mandatory to validate a new engineered construct as the <i>in vitro</i> phase lacks the essential <i>in vivo</i> environmental stimuli and because the <i>in vivo</i> culture allows for the testing of the biocompatibility and safety of a new material (18, 19). Moreover, preclinical animal models are crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms of cartilage lesions favoring the development of new regenerative strategies (20, 21). <i>in vivo</i> studies on animal models should focus on the analysis of the cellular component, analyzing the maintenance of the cellular phenotype and the tumorigenicity; on the evaluation of the biocompatibility, toxicity and degradation of the biomaterial and on the assessment of the engineered construct. In this manuscript, we will review the most common preclinical animal models, which are used to understand cartilage biology and therefore to develop new tissue engineering strategies. We will focus on both small and large animal models highlighting their peculiarities, advantages and drawbacks.",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,eng,2018,No Data
Study on the Performance of Recycled Coarse and Fine Aggregates as Microbial Carriers Applied to Self-Healing Concrete.,"The contradiction between the scarcity of natural resources and the demand for construction materials has given rise to the application of recycled aggregates. Microbial self-healing concrete (SHC) is a clean and smart material, and its carrier has a great influence on repair performance. In this paper, recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) and recycled fine aggregate (RFA) were used as carriers, and their different repair effects over time were intensively investigated. The results showed that the RCA carrier had a better repair effect compared with that of RFA, and the maximum healing width could reach 0.27 mm by 28 day. The microbial repair efficiency was significantly influenced by the distribution of old mortar, with the RFA specimen having a small volume and wide distribution of repair products, while the RCA repair showed a centralized tendency. In addition, SEM, MIP and XRD characterization were used to analyze the repair mechanism. The time-dependent repair model was developed, and the applicability of the model for concrete enhancement under microbial repair was verified through experimental results. The research results could promote industrial applications by giving intelligent and green properties to recycled aggregates.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2023,Mar
"Multi-layered cement-hydrogel composite with high toughness, low thermal conductivity, and self-healing capability.","The inherent quasi-brittleness of cement-based materials, due to the disorder of their hydration products and pore structures, present significant challenges for directional matrix toughening. In this work, a rigid layered skeleton of cement slurry was prepared using a simplified ice-template method, and subsequently flexible polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel was introduced into the unidirectional pores between neighboring cement platelets, resulting in the formation of a multi-layered cement-based composite. A toughness improvement of over 175 times is achieved by the implantation of such hard-soft alternatively layered microstructure. The toughening mechanism is the stretching of hydrogels at the nano-scale and deflections of micro-cracks at the interfaces, which avoid stress concentration and dissipate huge energy. Furthermore, this cement-hydrogel composite also exhibits a low thermal conductivity (around 1/10 of normal cement) and density, high specific strength and self-healing properties, which can be used in thermal insulation, seismic high-rise buildings and long-span bridges.",Nature communications,eng,2023,Jun
Engineered Injectable Cell-Laden Chitin/Chitosan Hydrogel with Adhesion and Biodegradability for Calvarial Defect Regeneration.,"Trade-off of high-strength and dynamic crosslinking of hydrogels remains an enormous challenge. Motivated by the self-healing property of biological tissues, the strategy of combining multiple dynamic bond mechanisms and a polysaccharide network is proposed to fabricate biomimetic hydrogels with sufficient mechanical strength, injectability, biodegradability, and self-healing property for bone reconstruction engineering. Stable acylhydrazone bonds endowed hydrogels with robust mechanical strength (>10 kPa). The integration of dynamic imine bonds and acylhydrazone bonds optimized the reversible characteristic to protect the cell during the injection and mimicked ECM microenvironment for cell differentiation as well as rapid adapting bone defect area. Furthermore, due to the slow enzymatic hydrolysis kinetics of chitosan and the self-healing properties of resulting networks, hydrogels exhibited a satisfactory biodegradation period (>8 weeks) that highly matches with bone regeneration. Additionally, rBMSC-laden hydrogels exhibited splendid osteogenic induction and bone reconstruction without prefabrication scaffolds and incubation, demonstrating tremendous potential for clinical application. This work proposes an efficient strategy for the construction of a low-cost multifunctional hydrogel, making polysaccharide-based hydrogels as the optimal carrier for enabling cellular functions in bone repair.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,May
In-Depth Profiling of Calcite Precipitation by Environmental Bacteria Reveals Fundamental Mechanistic Differences with Relevance to Application.,"Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) has not only helped to shape our planet's geological features but is also a promising technology to address environmental concerns in civil engineering applications. However, limited understanding of the biomineralization capacity of environmental bacteria impedes application. We therefore surveyed the environment for different mechanisms of precipitation across bacteria. The most fundamental difference was in ureolytic ability, where urease-positive bacteria caused rapid, widespread increases in pH, whereas nonureolytic strains produced such changes slowly and locally. These pH shifts correlated well with patterns of precipitation on solid medium. Strikingly, while both mechanisms led to high levels of precipitation, we observed clear differences in the precipitate. Ureolytic bacteria produced homogenous, inorganic fine crystals, whereas the crystals of nonureolytic strains were larger and had a mixed organic/inorganic composition. When representative strains were tested in application for crack healing in cement mortars, nonureolytic bacteria gave robust results, while ureolytic strains showed more variation. This may be explained by our observation that urease activity differed between growth conditions or by the different natures and therefore different material performances of the precipitates. Our results shed light on the breadth of biomineralization activity among environmental bacteria, an important step toward the rational design of bacterially based engineering solutions.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Biomineralization triggered by bacteria is important in the natural environment and has many applications in industry and in civil and geotechnical engineering. The diversity in biomineralization capabilities of environmental bacteria is, however, not well understood. This study surveyed environmental bacteria for their ability to precipitate calcium carbonate minerals and investigated both the mechanisms and the resulting crystals. We show that while urease activity leads to the fastest precipitation, it is by no means essential. Importantly, the same quantities of calcium carbonate are produced by nonureolytic bacteria, and the resulting crystals appear to have larger volumes and more organic components, which are likely beneficial in specific applications. Testing both precipitation mechanisms in a self-healing concrete application showed that nonureolytic bacteria delivered more robust results. Here, we performed a systematic study of the fundamental differences in biomineralization between environmental bacteria, and we provide important information for the design of bacterially based engineering solutions.",Applied and environmental microbiology,eng,2020,Mar
"High-Strength, Tough, Fatigue Resistant, and Self-Healing Hydrogel Based on Dual Physically Cross-Linked Network.","Hydrogels usually suffer from low mechanical strength, which largely limit their application in many fields. In this Research Article, we prepared a dual physically cross-linked hydrogel composed of poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PAM-co-PAA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) by simple two-steps methods of copolymerization and freezing/thawing. The hydrogen bond-associated entanglement of copolymer chains formed as cross-linking points to construct the first network. After being subjected to the freezing/thawing treatment, PVA crystalline domains were formed to serve as knots of the second network. The hydrogels were demonstrated to integrate strength and toughness (1230 ± 90 kPa and 1250 ± 50 kJ/m(3)) by the introduction of second physically cross-linked network. What̀s more, the hydrogels exhibited rapid recovery, excellent fatigue resistance, and self-healing property. The dynamic property of the dual physically cross-linked network contributes to the excellent energy dissipation and self-healing property. Therefore, this work provides a new route to understand the toughness mechanism of dual physically cross-linked hydrogels, hopefully promoting current hydrogel research and expanding their applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2016,Sep
"A Smart Design Strategy for Super-Elastic Hydrogel with Long-Term Moisture, Extreme Temperature Resistance, and Non-Flammability.","Elastic hydrogel is a promising material category for designing biological muscles, repairable building materials, flexible electronic devices, and vulcanized rubber substitutes, which is required to have a long life, good self-healing performance and extreme temperature tolerance. Herein, a super-elastic mineral hydrogel is developed with long-lasting moisture, based on dynamic physical crosslinking between hydrated calcium ion clusters and amide groups of polyacrylamide (PAM). The complex hydrogel exhibits a super stretchability of 13 600% at room temperature, and can maintain the super flexibility in a wide temperature range of -40-50 °C or for a long period of 28 days. Particularly, the soft material cannot be ignited under an open flame at 400-500 °C, because of coupling dual flame retardant mechanisms containing the endothermic effect of liquid water evaporation and the barrier effect of calcium mineral salt on oxygen. In conclusion, the novel complex hydrogel with excellent tensile property, stability in extreme temperature or long operating time, and flame retardancy may become a promising candidate in the fields of agriculture, food, construction, medicine, and machinery.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",eng,2021,Aug
Linking Molecular Behavior to Macroscopic Properties in Ideal Dynamic Covalent Networks.,"Dynamic covalent networks (DCvNs) are increasingly used in advanced materials design with applications ranging from recyclable thermosets to self-healing hydrogels. However, the relationship between the underlying chemistry at the junctions of DCvNs and their macroscopic properties is still not fully understood. In this work, we constructed a robust framework to predict how complex network behavior in DCvNs emerges from the chemical landscape of the dynamic chemistry at the junction. Ideal dynamic covalent boronic ester-based hydrogels were used as model DCvNs. We developed physical models that describe how viscoelastic properties, as measured by shear rheometry, are linked to the molecular behavior of the dynamic junction, quantified via fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Additionally, shear rheometry was combined with Transition State Theory to quantify the kinetics and thermodynamics of network rearrangements, enabling a mechanistic understanding including preferred reaction pathways for dynamic covalent chemistries. We applied this approach to corroborate the ""loose-bolt"" postulate for the reaction mechanism in Wulff-type boronic acids. These findings, grounded in molecular principles, advance our understanding and rational design of dynamic polymer networks, improving our ability to predict, design, and leverage their unique properties for future applications.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,eng,2020,Sep
Data of a stiffness softening mechanism effect on proliferation and differentiation of a human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell line towards the chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages.,"This article contains data related to the research article entitled ""Stiffness memory of indirectly 3D-printed elastomer nanohybrid regulates chondrogenesis and osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells"" [1] (Wu et al., 2018). Cells respond to the local microenvironment in a context dependent fashion and a continuous challenge is to provide a living construct that can adapt to the viscoelasticity changes of surrounding tissues. Several materials are attractive candidates to be used in tissue engineering, but conventional manufactured scaffolds are primarily static models with well-defined and stable stiffness that lack the dynamic biological nature required to undergo changes in substrate elasticity decisive in several cellular processes key during tissue development and wound healing. A family of poly (urea-urethane) (PUU) elastomeric nanohybrid scaffolds (PUU-POSS) with thermoresponsive mechanical properties that soften by reverse self-assembling at body temperature had been developed through a 3D thermal induced phase transition process (3D-TIPS) at various thermal conditions: cryo-coagulation (CC), cryo-coagulation and heating (CC + H) and room temperature coagulation and heating (RTC + H). The stiffness relaxation and stiffness softening of these scaffolds suggest regulatory effects in proliferation and differentiation of human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) towards the chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages.",Data in brief,eng,2018,Dec
Fabrication of Highly Thermally Resistant and Self-Healing Polysiloxane Elastomers by Constructing Covalent and Reversible Networks.,"The fabrication of self-healing elastomers with high thermal stability for use in extreme thermal conditions such as aerospace remains a major challenge. A strategy for preparing self-healing elastomers with stable covalent bonds and dynamic metal-ligand coordination interactions as crosslinking sites in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is proposed. The added Fe (III) not only serves as the dynamic crosslinking point at room temperature which is crucial for self-healing performance, but also plays a role as free radical scavenging agent at high temperatures. The results show that the PDMS elastomers possessed an initial thermal degradation temperature over 380 °C and a room temperature self-healing efficiency as high as 65.7%. Moreover, the char residue at 800 °C of PDMS elastomer reaches 7.19% in nitrogen atmosphere, and up to 14.02% in air atmosphere by doping a small amount (i.e., 0.3 wt%) of Fe (III), which is remarkable for the self-healing elastomers that contain weak and dynamic bonds with relatively poor thermal stability. This study provides an insight into designing self-healing PDMS-based materials that can be targeted for use as high-temperature thermal protection coatings.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2023,Sep
Cephalopods-Inspired Rapid Self-Healing Nanoclay Composite Coatings with Oxygen Barrier and Super-Bubble-Phobic Properties.,"Polymeric coatings with oxygen barrier properties are an important technology in food packaging that can extend the shelf life of food products and reduce waste. Although a typical technology in practical use is the deposition of metal or inorganic materials between multilayer films to reduce the oxygen transmission rate, once the film is damaged, oxygen permeates through the damaged area, damaging the packaged food. In addition, nanobrick wall structures consisting of nanoplatelet bricks have the potential to replace barrier films made of inorganic materials; however, they similarly lack repair performance or have slow repair speed despite having repair performance. Inspired by the rapid self-repair mechanism of cephalopods, the study develops a nanoclay-containing coating that can rapidly repair surface damage via water within 10 s. By introducing CaCl<sub>2</sub>-derived counterions and montmorillonite for nanobrick wall structures into polyelectrolyte multilayers stacked by layer-by-layer self-assembly, the noncovalent polymer network is increased, resulting in mimicking a strong cephalopod-derived β-sheet structure and noncovalent intermolecular interactions derived from cephalopods. The high water retention at the surface showed super-bubble-phobicity in water and inhibited gas permeation. The oxygen permeability of the coatings with more than a certain amount of montmorillonite was less than 1/100 of that of bare polyethylene. The ultrafast self-healing gas barrier coating has the potential to be used not only for food products but also for electronics and pharmaceutical packaging and gas separation applications. The key technology developed in this study provides novel insights into the construction of self-healing membranes made of composite materials and will contribute to the formation of a sustainable society.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Aug
Layer-by-Layer Microneedle-Mediated rhEGF Transdermal Delivery for Enhanced Wound Epidermal Regeneration and Angiogenesis.,"Appropriate treatments for acute traumas tend to avoid hemorrhages, vascular damage, and infections. However, in the homeostasis-imbalanced wound microenvironment, currently developed therapies could not precisely and controllably deliver biomacromolecular drugs, which are confronted with challenges due to large molecular weight, poor biomembrane permeability, low dosage, rapid degradation, and bioactivity loss. To conquer this, we construct a simple and effective layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly transdermal delivery patch, bearing microneedles (MN) coated with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (LBL MN-rhEGF) for a sustained release to wound bed driven by typical electrostatic force. Pyramidal LBL MN-rhEGF patches hold so enough mechanical strength to penetrate the stratum corneum, and generated microchannels allow rhEGF direct delivery in situ. The administrable delivery of biomacromolecular rhEGF through hierarchically coated MN arrays follows the diffusion mechanism of Fick's second law. Numerous efforts further have illustrated that finger-pressing LBL MN-rhEGF patches could not only promote cell proliferation of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) <i>in vitro</i> but also take significant effects (regenerative epidermis: ∼144 μm; pro-angiogenesis: higher CD31 expression) in accelerating wound healing of mechanically injured rats, compared to the traditional dressing, which relies on passive diffusion. Our proof-of-concept features novel LBL biomacromolecular drug-delivery systems and self-administrated precision medicine modes at the point of care.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,May
Ultrastretchable Conductive Polymer Complex as a Strain Sensor with a Repeatable Autonomous Self-Healing Ability.,"Wearable strain sensors are essential for the realization of applications in the broad fields of remote healthcare monitoring, soft robots, and immersive gaming, among many others. These flexible sensors should be comfortably adhered to the skin and capable of monitoring human motions with high accuracy, as well as exhibiting excellent durability. However, it is challenging to develop electronic materials that possess the properties of skin-compliant, elastic, stretchable, and self-healable. This work demonstrates a new regenerative polymer complex composed of poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid), polyaniline, and phytic acid as a skin-like electronic material. It exhibits ultrahigh stretchability (1935%), repeatable autonomous self-healing ability (repeating healing efficiency >98%), quadratic response to strain ( R<sup>2</sup> > 0.9998), and linear response to flexion bending ( R<sup>2</sup> > 0.9994), outperforming current reported wearable strain sensors. The deprotonated polyelectrolyte, multivalent anion, and doped conductive polymer, under ambient conditions, synergistically construct a regenerative dynamic network of polymer complex cross-linked by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, which enables ultrahigh stretchability and repeatable self-healing. Sensitive strain-responsive geometric and piezoresistive mechanisms of the material owing to the homogeneous and viscoelastic nature provide excellent linear responses to omnidirectional tensile strain and bending deformations. Furthermore, this material is scalable and simple to process in an environmentally friendly manner, paving the way for the next-generation flexible electronics.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2019,Jun
Bacteria incorporated with calcium lactate pentahydrate to improve the mortar properties and self-healing occurrence.,"Concrete can be harmful to the environment due to its high energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emission and also has a potential crack formation, which can promote a drop in its strength. Therefore, concrete is considered as a non-sustainable material. The mechanisms by which bacterial oxidation of organic carbon can precipitate calcite that may fill the voids and cracks on cement-based materials have been extensively investigated to prevent and heal the micro-cracks formation. Hence, this study focused on utilizing a new alkaliphilic bacterial strain indigenous to an Indonesian site, Lysinibacillus sphaericus strain SKC/VA-1, incorporated with calcium lactate pentahydrate, as a low-cost calcium source, with various bacterial inoculum concentrations. The bacterium was employed in this study due to its ability to adapt to basic pH, thus improving the physical properties and rejuvenating the micro-cracks. Experimentally, the addition of calcium lactate pentahydrate slightly affected the mortar properties. Likewise, bacteria-incorporated mortar exhibited an enhancement in the physical properties of mortar. The highest improvement of mechanical properties (an increase of 45% and 36% for compressive and indirect tensile strength, respectively) was achieved by the addition of calcium lactate pentahydrate incorporated with 10% v/v bacterial inoculum [about 7 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml (colony-forming unit/ml)]. The self-healing took place more rapidly on bacterial mortar supplemented with calcium lactate pentahydrate than on the control specimen. XRD analysis demonstrated that the mineralogical composition of self-healing precipitates was primarily dominated by calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), indicating the capacity of L. sphaericus strain SKC/VA-1 to precipitate calcite through organic carbon oxidation for self-healing the artificial crack on the mortar. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the potential utilization of the bacterium L. sphaericus incorporated with calcium lactate pentahydrate to increase the mortar properties, including its self-healing ability. However, further study with the water-cement ratio variation is required to investigate the possibility of using L. sphaericus and calcium lactate pentahydrate as an alternative method rather than reducing the water-cement ratio to enhance the mortar properties.",Scientific reports,eng,2020,Oct
Direct and Efficient Incorporation of DOPA into Resilin-Like Proteins Enables Cross-Linking into Tunable Hydrogels.,"3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), a naturally occurring yet noncanonical amino acid, endows protein polymers with diverse chemical reactivities and novel functionalities. Although many efforts have been made to incorporate DOPA into proteins, the incorporation efficiency and production titer remain low and severely hinder the exploration of these peculiar proteins for biomaterial fabrication. Here, we report an efficient biosynthetic strategy to produce large amounts of DOPA-incorporated structural proteins for the fabrication of hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties. First, synthetic genes were constructed that encode repetitive resilin-like proteins (RLPs) with varying proportions of tyrosine residues and molecular weights (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>). Decoding of these genes into RLPs incorporated with DOPA was achieved via mis-aminoacylation of DOPA by endogenous tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) in recombinant <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells. By developing a stoichiometry-guided two-phase culture strategy, we achieved independent control of the bacterial growth and protein synthesis phases. This enabled hyperproduction of the DOPA-incorporated RLPs at gram-per-liter levels and with a high DOPA incorporation yield of 76-85%. The purified DOPA-containing RLPs were then successfully cross-linked into bulk hydrogels via facile DOPA-Fe<sup>3+</sup> complexations. Interestingly, these hydrogels exhibited viscoelastic and self-healing properties that are highly dependent on the catechol content and <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> of the RLPs. Finally, exploration of the molecular cross-linking mechanisms revealed that higher DOPA contents of the proteins would result in the concomitant occurrence of metal coordination and oxidative covalent cross-linking. In summary, our results suggest a useful platform to generate DOPA-functionalized protein materials and provide deeper insights into the gelation systems based on DOPA chemistry.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2023,Apr
Effect of the Combination of Superabsorbent Polymers for Autogenous Shrinkage Control with Steel Fibers of High-Performance Concrete under Uniaxial Tension Using DIC.,"This paper presents a study of the effect of a superabsorbent polymer (SAP) for autogenous shrinkage control on the uniaxial tensile behavior of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC). The use of fibers and SAP potentially increases the durability of the concrete, preventing cracking by autogenous shrinkage and enhancing post-cracking behavior. Furthermore, SAP can provide further hydration for self-healing purposes and improve the ductility of the SFRC. In order to evaluate the effect of the addition of SAP in SFRC, dog-bone SFRC specimens with different dosages of superabsorbent polymers were cast and tested under uniaxial tension. The digital image correlation (DIC) technique was used to understand the effect of SAP on the steel fibers' crack-bridging mechanisms. Surface strains and crack openings were inferred using the DIC technique. The effect of SAP and fibers on fresh and hardened concrete was individually investigated by flow tests and compressive strength tests. Autogenous shrinkage was measured in plain concrete to investigate the minimum SAP content required to mitigate autogenous shrinkage of 0.3%. The use of 0.3% SAP was also sufficient to reach multiple cracking behavior. This content of SAP completely suppressed the autogenous shrinkage with minimal side effects on compressive strength. An analytical formulation for the tensile behavior of SFRC was developed using the variable engagement model, presenting a mean correlation of R<sup>2</sup> of 0.97 with the experimental results.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Oct
Self-healable nanocellulose composite hydrogels combining multiple dynamic bonds for drug delivery.,"Herein, we developed two nanocomposite polysaccharide hydrogels TPP-CNC and TPP-CNF via simple mixing method, which were constructed with multiple dynamic bonds. The microstructural features, mechanical properties, rheological properties, healable ability and biocompatibility of the complex hydrogels were evaluated. The TPP-CNC and TPP-CNF complex hydrogels exhibited higher tensile strength than pure polysaccharide hydrogel, from ~259 KPa to ~890 KPa and ~910 KPa, respectively, that was attributed to the contribution of ionic crosslinked network and hydrogen bonds. In addition, the hydrogels indicated superior fatigue resistance and high energy dissipation ratio during loading-unloading tests because of the physical sacrifice bonds, which also decreased the self-healing time at room temperature (~15 min). More importantly, the drug loaded nanocomposite hydrogels showed sustained release, reduction burst release, increased release under acidic environment, and the drug release kinetics belonged to Fickian diffusion mechanism. Therefore, the nanocellulose polysaccharide hydrogels have the highly promising to explore as biomaterials for drug delivery.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2022,Apr
Injectable shear-thinning hydrogels engineered with a self-assembling Dock-and-Lock mechanism.,"Injected therapeutics, such as cells or biological molecules, may have enhanced efficiency when delivered within a scaffold carrier. Here, we describe a dual-component Dock-and-Lock (DnL) self-assembly mechanism that can be used to construct shear-thinning, self-healing, and injectable hydrogels. One component is derived from the RIIα subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase A and is engineered as a telechelic protein with end groups that dimerize (docking step). The second component is derived from the anchoring domain of A-kinase anchoring protein (AD) and is attached to multi-arm crosslinker polymers and binds to the docked proteins (locking step). When mixed, these two DnL components form robust physical hydrogels instantaneously and under physiological conditions. Mechanical properties and erosion rates of DnL gels can be tuned through the AD peptide sequence, the concentration and ratio of each component, and the number of peptides on the cross-linking polymer. DnL gels immediately self-recover after deformation, are resistant to yield at strains as high as 400%, and completely self-heal irrespective of prior mechanical disruption. Mesenchymal stem cells mixed in DnL gels and injected through a fine needle remain highly viable (>90%) during the encapsulation and delivery process, and encapsulated large molecules are released with profiles that correspond to gel erosion. Thus, we have used molecular engineering strategies to develop cytocompatible and injectable hydrogels that have the potential to support cell and drug therapies.",Biomaterials,eng,2012,Mar
Self-Reducible Conjugated Microporous Polyaniline for Long-Term Selective Cr(VI) Detoxication Driven by Tunable Pore Dimension.,"A simple methodology to controllably tune the pore size and Cr(VI) adsorption capacity was reported herein to synthesize a new series of conjugated microporous polyaniline (CMPA) networks. The well-ordered micropore was acquired through our very recent Bristol-Xi'an Jiaotong method, and the pore size was fine-tuned to increase with the increasing length of linkers, mimicking covalent organic frameworks and metal organic frameworks very much. A selective ultrahigh adsorption capacity of 520.8 mg/g was achieved by CMPA-1 in a very fast manner, with a systematically gradual decrease to 173.9 mg/g of CMPA-3 by enlarging the pore size of the networks, featuring tunable adsorption capacity through molecular-size-recognition mechanism. Additionally, our robust CMPA networks, which were constructed by Buchwald-Hartwig chemistry, showed the complete function of polyaniline and were capable of providing, besides large storage capacity for Cr(III), at least 10 reductant/desorption-free cycles for effective Cr(VI) reduction and detoxication through their novel self-reducible redox states. Outcomes showed that our CMPAs could be applied as new self-healing scavengers in the next generation for Cr(VI) storage and detoxication.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Jun

Degradable Temperature-Sensitive Hydrogel Loaded with Heparin Effectively Prevents Post-Operative Tissue Adhesions.,"Tissue adhesions could occur following surgeries, and severe tissue adhesions can lead to serious complications. Medical hydrogels could be applied at surgical sites as a physical barrier to prevent tissue adhesion. For practical reasons, spreadable, degradable, and self-healable gels are highly demanded. To meet these requirements, we applied carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) to poloxamer-based hydrogels to generate low Poloxamer<sub>338</sub> (P<sub>338</sub>) content gels displaying low viscosity at refrigerator temperature and improved mechanical strength at body temperature. Heparin, an effective adhesion inhibitor, was also added to construct P<sub>338</sub>/CMCS-heparin composite hydrogel (PCHgel). PCHgel presents as a flowable liquid below 20 °C and could rapidly transform into gel when spread on the surface of damaged tissue due to temperature change. The introduction of CMCS enabled hydrogels to form a stable self-healable barrier at injured positions and slowly release heparin during the wound healing period before being degraded after ∼14 days. Ultimately, PCHgel significantly reduced tissue adhesion in model rats and displayed higher efficiency than P<sub>338</sub>/CMCS gel without heparin.

The Mechanical Properties of Poly (Urea-Formaldehyde) Incorporated with Nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> by Molecular Dynamics Simulation.,"Self-healing materials can promote the sustainable reuse of resources. Poly (urea-formaldehyde) (PUF) microcapsules can be incorporated into dielectric materials for self-healing. However, the mechanical properties of PUF microcapsules need to be improved due to insufficient hardness. In this paper, PUF models incorporated with nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> of different filler concentrations (0, 2.6, 3.7, 5.3, 6.7, 7.9 wt.%) were designed. The density, the fractional free volume, and the mechanical properties of the PUF-SiO<sub>2</sub> models were analyzed at an atomic level based on molecular dynamics simulation. The interfacial interaction model of PUF on the SiO<sub>2</sub> surface was also constructed to further investigate the interaction mechanisms. The results showed that the incorporation of nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> had a significant effect on the mechanical properties of PUF. Density increased, fractional free volume decreased, and mechanical properties of the PUF materials were gradually enhanced with the increase of nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This trend was also confirmed by experimental tests. By analyzing the internal mechanism of the PUF-SiO<sub>2</sub> interfacial interaction, it was found that hydrogen bonds play a major role in the interaction between PUF and nano-SiO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, hydrogen bonds can be formed between the polar atoms of the PUF chain and the hydroxyl groups (-OH) as well as O atoms on the surface of SiO<sub>2</sub>. Hydrogen bonds interactions are involved in adsorption of PUF chains on the SiO<sub>2</sub> surface, reducing the distance between PUF chains and making the system denser, thus enhancing the mechanical properties of PUF materials.",Polymers,eng,2019,Sep
Protein-Metal-Ion Networks: A Unique Approach toward Metal Sulfide Nanoparticles Embedded In Situ in Nanocomposites.,"Nanoscale metal sulfides are of tremendous potential in biomedicine. Generally, the properties and performances of metal sulfide nanoparticles (NPs) are highly related to their structures, sizes and morphologies. Recently, a strategy of using sulfur-containing protein-metal-ion networks for preparing metal sulfide embedded nanocomposites was proposed. Within the networks, proteins can play multiple roles to drive the transformation of these networks into protein-encapsulated metal sulfide NPs with ultrasmall size and defined structure (as both a template and a sulfur provider) or metal sulfide NP-protein hydrogels with injecting and self-healing properties (as a template, a sulfur provider, and a gelator) in a controlled manner. In this Concept, the synthesis strategy, the formation mechanism, and the biomedical applications of the gained nanocomposites are presented. Moreover, the challenges and opportunities of using protein-metal ion networks to construct functional materials for biomedical applications are analyzed.","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",eng,2019,Jan
Self-healable castor oil-based waterborne polyurethane/MXene film with outstanding electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness and excellent shape memory performance.,"Recently, the increasing demands of the portable devices and flexible electronics have caused lots of electromagnetic wave pollution. MXene, a novel two-dimensional material, was considered as a promising two-dimensional material for preparing flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding films. Herein, we firstly synthesized a series of flexible and self-healable EMI shielding waterborne polyurethane (ADWPU) films by mechanically blending with Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> (ADWPU-T). Interestingly, the self-assembling between ADWPU and Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> constructed a tunable analogical structure providing reflection-absorption-multiple reflection shielding mechanism. Furthermore, the ADWPU-T emulsions were prepared from castor oil which is a low-cost and eco-friendly biomass polyol. The chain extender 2-aminophenyl disulfide endow a reversible dynamic polymer network which leading to shape memory performance (45°C heat treatment) and self-healing ability (60°C, 5 min healed). Above all, these multifunctional flexible films also exhibited outstanding EMI shielding performance (51.37 dB) and performed less decrement after 200 times bending and 80°C aging test for five days. Therefore, this work would provide a novel promising method for preparing responsive electromagnetic interference shielding products and smart electronic devices.",Journal of colloid and interface science,eng,2021,Apr
Amorphous TiO2 shells: an essential elastic buffer layer for high-performance self-healing eutectic GaSn nano-droplet room-temperature liquid metal battery.,"Gallium-based alloy liquid metal batteries currently face limitations such as volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and substantial capacity decay. In this study, amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eutectic GaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core-shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell (~6.5 nm) formed a stable SEI film, alleviated the volume expansion, and provided electron/ion transport channels to achieve excellent cycling performance and high specific capacity. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibited high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 C, respectively. No significant decay was observed after more than 500 cycles with a capacity of 455 mAh g-1 at 1 C. In situ X-ray diffraction (in situ XRD) was used to explore the lithiation mechanism of the eGaSn negative electrode during discharge. This study elucidates the design of advanced liquid alloy-based negative electrode materials for high-performance liquid metal batteries (LMBs).","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",eng,2023,Aug
Strategy for Constructing Phosphorus-Based Flame-Retarded Polyurethane Elastomers for Advanced Performance in Long-Term.,"Polyurethane elastomer (PUE), which is widely used in coatings for construction, transportation, electronics, aerospace, and other fields, has excellent physical properties. However, polyurethane elastomers are flammable, which limits their daily use, so the flame retardancy of polyurethane elastomers is very important. Reactive flame retardants have the advantages of little influence on the physical properties of polymers and low tendency to migrate out. Due to the remarkable needs of non-halogenated flame retardants, phosphorus flame retardant has gradually stood out as the main alternative. In this review, we focus on the fire safety of PUE and provide a detailed overview of the current molecular design and mechanisms of reactive phosphorus-containing, as well as P-N synergistic, flame retardants in PUE. From the structural characteristics, several basic aspects of PUE are overviewed, including thermal performance, combustion performance, and mechanical properties. In addition, the perspectives on the future advancement of phosphorus-containing flame-retarded polyurethane elastomers (PUE) are also discussed. Based on the past research, this study provides prospects for the application of flame-retarded PUE in the fields of self-healing materials, bio-based materials, wearable electronic devices, and solid-state electrolytes.",Polymers,eng,2023,Sep
Characteristics of an underground stope channel supplied by atmospheric precipitation and its water disaster prevention in the karst mining areas of Guizhou.,"Atmospheric precipitation floods mining areas, which seriously affects the safe production of coal mines. However, research on the mechanism underlying precipitation supplying coal mines, particularly in karst landform areas, remains far from sufficient. Based on the collection of a large amount of geological and hydrogeological mining data and some data related to mine atmospheric precipitation and mine water inflow, the channels of atmospheric precipitation supplying mines in the main coal-producing areas of Guizhou, China, are systematically analysed and studied. They are divided into weathering zone fractures, mining fractures, water diversion faults, water diversion collapse columns and karst channels. Recharge channels have the characteristics of surface infiltration, pipeline flow and layered recharge, as well as self-healing after being filled by surface loess and other materials. The supply of atmospheric precipitation to the coal mine stope is seasonal. The mine water inflow in the rainy season is 1.2 ~ 12 times that in the dry season, with an average of 1.9 times. The supply has hysteresis. The lag time of surface infiltration, pipeline flow and layered flow is 2 ~ 4 days, within 24 h and more than 2 days, respectively. The recharge is affected by the burial depth of the coal seam and the characteristics of the combined upper roof slate. Among the mines affected by atmospheric precipitation and water disasters, some mines have carried out research on the comprehensive treatment of water disasters, implemented supplementary exploration projects such as surface hydrogeological drilling and geophysical exploration, or carried out hydrochemical research. Some mines have adopted water prevention and control projects, such as blocking ground water diversion cracks, constructing water diversion projects, adjusting the mining time of the working face, transforming the drainage system and improving the drainage capacity, to ensure the safe production of mines. This research achievement may provide a theoretical basis and practical experience for the prevention and control of atmospheric precipitation infiltration in coal mines in karst areas.",Scientific reports,eng,2023,Sep
MicroRNA-30c delivered by bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells induced apoptosis and diminished cell invasion in U-251 glioblastoma cell line.,"Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is the most belligerent and prevalent brain malignancy among adults. Due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), drug administration is confronted by massive challenges, making resectional surgery the only treatment pipeline. MicroRNAs have recently absorbed the attention of studies for correlating with the progression of various malignancies. miR-30c has been reported to play a role in cell proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis process. For instance, miR-30c has been reported to regulate apoptosis through the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). miR-30c also targets IL-6, which further induces apoptosis. Besides, miR-30c inhibits glioma proliferation and its migratory ability. Besides, the overexpression of miR-30c arrested cells at G0 as well as dampening their migration and invasion. However, it has been shown that the expression level of miR-30c was low in glioma. MSCs can migrate toward tumor cells which is called tumor-tropism, in which they are capable of delivering engineered miR-30c based on gap junction and non-intimacy mechanisms.",Life sciences,eng,2021,Aug
Sacrificial bonds and hidden length: unraveling molecular mesostructures in tough materials.,"Sacrificial bonds and hidden length in structural molecules and composites have been found to greatly increase the fracture toughness of biomaterials by providing a reversible, molecular-scale energy-dissipation mechanism. This mechanism relies on the energy, of order 100 eV, needed to reduce entropy and increase enthalpy as molecular segments are stretched after being released by the breaking of weak bonds, called sacrificial bonds. This energy is relatively large compared to the energy needed to break the polymer backbone, of order a few eV. In many biological cases, the breaking of sacrificial bonds has been found to be reversible, thereby additionally providing a ""self-healing"" property to the material. Due to the nanoscopic nature of this mechanism, single molecule force spectroscopy using an atomic force microscope has been a useful tool to investigate this mechanism. Especially when investigating natural molecular constructs, force versus distance curves quickly become very complicated. In this work we propose various types of sacrificial bonds, their combination, and how they appear in single molecule force spectroscopy measurements. We find that by close analysis of the force spectroscopy curves, additional information can be obtained about the molecules and their bonds to the native constructs.",Biophysical journal,eng,2006,Feb
