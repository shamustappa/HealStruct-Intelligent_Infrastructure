Self-Healing Concrete as a Prospective Construction Material: A Review.,"Concrete is a material that is widely used in the construction market due to its availability and cost, although it is prone to fracture formation. Therefore, there has been a surge in interest in self-healing materials, particularly self-healing capabilities in green and sustainable concrete materials, with a focus on different techniques offered by dozens of researchers worldwide in the last two decades. However, it is difficult to choose the most effective approach because each research institute employs its own test techniques to assess healing efficiency. Self-healing concrete (SHC) has the capacity to heal and lowers the requirement to locate and repair internal damage (e.g., cracks) without the need for external intervention. This limits reinforcement corrosion and concrete deterioration, as well as lowering costs and increasing durability. Given the merits of SHCs, this article presents a thorough review on the subject, considering the strategies, influential factors, mechanisms, and efficiency of self-healing. This literature review also provides critical synopses on the properties, performance, and evaluation of the self-healing efficiency of SHC composites. In addition, we review trends of development in research toward a broad understanding of the potential application of SHC as a superior concrete candidate and a turning point for developing sustainable and durable concrete composites for modern construction today. Further, it can be imagined that SHC will enable builders to construct buildings without fear of damage or extensive maintenance. Based on this comprehensive review, it is evident that SHC is a truly interdisciplinary hotspot research topic integrating chemistry, microbiology, civil engineering, material science, etc. Furthermore, limitations and future prospects of SHC, as well as the hotspot research topics for future investigations, are also successfully highlighted.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Apr
Self-Healing Hydrogel Embodied with Macrophage-Regulation and Responsive-Gene-Silencing Properties for Synergistic Prevention of Peritendinous Adhesion.,"Antiadhesion barriers such as films and hydrogels used to wrap repaired tendons are important for preventing the formation of adhesion tissue after tendon surgery. However, sliding of the tendon can compress the adjacent hydrogel barrier and cause it to rupture, which may then lead to unexpected inflammation. Here, a self-healing and deformable hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogel is constructed as a peritendinous antiadhesion barrier. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)-degradable gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) microspheres (MSs) encapsulated with Smad3-siRNA nanoparticles are entrapped within the HA hydrogel to inhibit fibroblast proliferation and prevent peritendinous adhesion. GelMA MSs are responsively degraded by upregulation of MMP-2, achieving on-demand release of siRNA nanoparticles. Silencing effect of Smad3-siRNA nanoparticles is around 75% toward targeted gene. Furthermore, the self-healing hydrogel shows relatively attenuated inflammation compared to non-healing hydrogel. The mean adhesion scores of composite barrier group are 1.67 ± 0.51 and 2.17 ± 0.75 by macroscopic and histological evaluation, respectively. The proposed self-healing hydrogel antiadhesion barrier with MMP-2-responsive drug release behavior is highly effective for decreasing inflammation and inhibiting tendon adhesion. Therefore, this research provides a new strategy for the development of safe and effective antiadhesion barriers.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2022,Feb
pH/Glucose Dual Responsive Metformin Release Hydrogel Dressings with Adhesion and Self-Healing via Dual-Dynamic Bonding for Athletic Diabetic Foot Wound Healing.,"In view of the lack of a specific drug-sustained release system that is responsive to chronic wounds of the type II diabetic foot, and the demands for frequent movement at the foot wound, pH/glucose dual-responsive metformin-released adhesion-enhanced self-healing easy-removable antibacterial antioxidant conductive hemostasis multifunctional phenylboronic acid and benzaldehyde bifunctional polyethylene glycol-<i>co</i>-poly(glycerol sebacic acid)/dihydrocaffeic acid and l-arginine cografted chitosan (PEGS-PBA-BA/CS-DA-LAG, denoted as PC) hydrogel dressings were constructed based on the double dynamic bond of the Schiff-base and phenylboronate ester. It was further demonstrated that the PC hydrogel promotes wound healing by reducing inflammation and enhancing angiogenesis in a rat type II diabetic foot model. In addition, the addition of metformin (Met) and graphene oxide (GO), as well as their synergy, were confirmed to better promote wound repair <i>in vivo</i>. In summary, adhesion-enhanced self-healing multifunctional PC/GO/Met hydrogels with stimuli-responsive metformin release ability and easy removability have shown a promoting effect on the healing of chronic athletic diabetic wounds and provide a local-specific drug dual-response release strategy for the treatment of type II diabetic feet.",ACS nano,eng,2022,Feb
Recent Advances in Intrinsic Self-Healing Cementitious Materials.,"Self-healing is a natural phenomenon whereby living organisms respond to damage. Recently, considerable research efforts have been invested in self-healing cementitious materials that are capable of restoring structural integrity and mechanical properties after being damaged.

Here, the current advances in the development of the intrinsic healing cementitious materials are described, and a new definition of intrinsic self-healing discussed. The methods to assess the efficiency of different healing mechanisms are briefly summarized. The critical insights are emphasized to guide the future research on the development of new self-healing cementitious materials.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2018,Apr
Self-Healing Mechanism of Lithium in Lithium Metal.,"Li is an ideal anode material for use in state-of-the-art secondary batteries. However, Li-dendrite growth is a safety concern and results in low coulombic efficiency, which significantly restricts the commercial application of Li secondary batteries. Unfortunately, the Li-deposition (growth) mechanism is poorly understood on the atomic scale. Here, machine learning is used to construct a Li potential model with quantum-mechanical computational accuracy. Molecular dynamics simulations in this study with this model reveal two self-healing mechanisms in a large Li-metal system, viz. surface self-healing, and bulk self-healing. It is concluded that self-healing occurs rapidly in nanoscale; thus, minimizing the voids between the Li grains using several comprehensive methods can effectively facilitate the formation of dendrite-free Li.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",eng,2022,Apr
Advances in multifunctional chitosan-based self-healing hydrogels for biomedical applications.,"Multifunctional self-healing hydrogels have recently attracted considerable interest in biomedical applications owing to their diverse properties, including self-healing, adhesion, conduction, antibacterial, and stimulus-response, which can meet various application requirements, ranging from wound dressings and delivery vehicles to the production of scaffolds for tissue repair and regeneration. As a natural polycationic polysaccharide with good biocompatibility, chitosan is widely used in hydrogel formation as there are many amino and hydroxyl groups along the chains that can actively participate in various physical effects and chemical reactions, which enable it to construct self-healing hydrogels and fulfill multiple functions. In this review, the formation of chitosan-based self-healing hydrogels and the related self-healing mechanism are summarized, including Schiff base, metal coordination, ionic and hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic and host-guest interactions, with a focus on the strategies for their multi-functionalization. In the last section, the applications of the chitosan-based self-healing hydrogels in the fields of wound dressings, delivery vehicles, scaffolds, and biological sensors are discussed. Overall, it is highly expected that this review could provide an insight into the prospective development of multifunctional self-healing hydrogels for biomedical applications.",Journal of materials chemistry.

The role of natural polymers in bone tissue engineering.,"Bone is a dynamic self-healing organ and a continuous remodeling ensures the restoration of the bone structure and function over time. However, bone remodeling is not able to repair large traumatic injuries. Therefore, surgical interventions and bone substitutes are required. The aim of bone tissue engineering is to repair and regenerate tissues and engineered a bone graft as a bone substitute. To met this goal, several natural or synthetic polymers have been used to develop a biocompatible and biodegradable polymeric construct. Among the polymers, natural polymers have higher biocompatibility, excellent biodegradability, and no toxicity. So far, collagen, chitosan, gelatin, silk fibroin, alginate, cellulose, and starch, alone or in combination, have been widely used in bone tissue engineering. These polymers have been used as scaffolds, hydrogels, and micro-nanospheres. The functionalization of the polymer with growth factors and bioactive glasses increases the potential use of polymers for bone regeneration. As bone is a dynamic highly vascularized tissue, the vascularization of the polymeric scaffolds is vital for successful bone regeneration. Several in vivo and in vitro strategies have been used to vascularize the polymeric scaffolds. In this review, the application of the most commonly used natural polymers is discussed.",Journal of controlled release : official journal of the Controlled Release Society,eng,2021,Oct
Prolonged in situ self-healing in structural composites via thermo-reversible entanglement.,"Natural processes continuously degrade a material's performance throughout its life cycle. An emerging class of synthetic self-healing polymers and composites possess property-retaining functions with the promise of longer lifetimes. But sustained in-service repair of structural fiber-reinforced composites remains unfulfilled due to material heterogeneity and thermodynamic barriers in commonly cross-linked polymer-matrix constituents. Overcoming these inherent challenges for mechanical self-recovery is vital to extend in-service operation and attain widespread adoption of such bioinspired structural materials. Here we transcend existing obstacles and report a fiber-composite capable of minute-scale and prolonged in situ healing - 100 cycles: an order of magnitude higher than prior studies. By 3D printing a mendable thermoplastic onto woven glass/carbon fiber reinforcement and co-laminating with electrically resistive heater interlayers, we achieve in situ thermal remending of internal delamination via dynamic bond re-association. Full fracture recovery occurs below the glass-transition temperature of the thermoset epoxy-matrix composite, thus preserving stiffness during and after repair. A discovery of chemically driven improvement in thermal remending of glass- over carbon-fiber composites is also revealed. The marked lifetime extension offered by this self-healing strategy mitigates costly maintenance, facilitates repair of difficult-to-access structures (e.g., wind-turbine blades), and reduces part replacement, thereby benefiting economy and environment.",Nature communications,eng,2022,Oct
Biomimetic Self-Healing Cementitious Construction Materials for Smart Buildings.,"Climate change is anticipated to have a major impact on concrete structures through increasing rates of deterioration as well the impacts of extreme weather events. The deterioration can affect directly or indirectly climate change in addition to the variation in the carbon dioxide concentration, temperature and relative humidity. The deterioration that occurs from the very beginning of the service not only reduces the lifespan of the concretes but also demands more cement to maintain the durability. Meanwhile, the repair process of damaged parts is highly labor intensive and expensive. Thus, the self-healing of such damages is essential for the environmental safety and energy cost saving. The design and production of the self-healing as well as sustainable concretes are intensely researched within the construction industries. Based on these factors, this article provides the materials and methods required for a comprehensive assessment of self-healing concretes. Past developments, recent trends, environmental impacts, sustainability, merits and demerits of several methods for the production of self-healing concrete are discussed and analyzed.","Biomimetics (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Oct
Advances in Injectable and Self-healing Polysaccharide Hydrogel Based on the Schiff Base Reaction.,"Injectable hydrogel possesses great application potential in disease treatment and tissue engineering, but damage to gel often occurs due to the squeezing pressure from injection devices and the mechanical forces from limb movement, and leads to the rapid degradation of gel matrix and the leakage of the load material. The self-healing injectable hydrogels can overcome these drawbacks via automatically repairing gel structural defects and restoring gel function. The polysaccharide hydrogels constructed through the Schiff base reaction own advantages including simple fabrication, injectability, and self-healing under physiological conditions, and therefore have drawn extensive attention and investigation recently. In this short review, the preparation and self-healing properties of the polysaccharide hydrogels that is established on the Schiff base reaction are focused on and their biological applications in drug delivery and cell therapy are discussed.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2021,May
"Self-Healing Polymeric Composite Material Design, Failure Analysis and Future Outlook: A Review.","The formation of micro-cracks and crack propagation is still an acute problem in polymer and polymer composites. These micro-cracks usually occur while the materials are manufactured or serviced. The development and coalescence of these cracks reduces the lifespan and brings about a catastrophic failure of the materials. Novel scientific research on polymeric self-healing is emphasised in a number of publications, which consist of contributions from many of the prominent researchers in this area. Progress in this field can eventually enable scientist to construct new flexible materials that both monitor the material's integrity and repair the deformed material prior to the occurrence of any fatal failures. This report describes recent trends that have been used in material science and computational methods to mitigate the development of micro-cracks and crack propagation in polymer composites.",Polymers,eng,2017,Oct
The Construction of a Footbridge Prototype with Biological Self-Healing Concrete: A Field Study in a Humid Continental Climate Region.,"Biological self-healing concrete (BSHC) offers a sustainable and economical way of increasing the lifespan of structures vulnerable to cracking. In recent decades, an enormous research effort has been dedicated to developing and optimizing the bacterial healing process. Nevertheless, most studies have been carried out under laboratory conditions. To verify the effectiveness and longevity of the embedded healing systems under normal service conditions, field studies on BSHC structures must be performed. In the present study, BSHC beams were designed as a structural part of a prototype footbridge. To select the optimal BSHC mix composition, a series of laboratory tests were also carried out. Laboratory tests have shown that the healing ratio in BSHC elements under rain-simulating healing conditions was several times higher in comparison to control specimens. Based on the laboratory results, the BSHC mix composition was selected and applied for structural bridge beams. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the present study reports the first application of BSHC in a prototype footbridge. The long-term data gathered on the healing process in a humid continental climate zone will allow the benefits of biological self-healing to be quantitatively evaluated and will pave the way for the further optimization of this material.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Dec
Glucose and MMP-9 dual-responsive hydrogel with temperature sensitive self-adaptive shape and controlled drug release accelerates diabetic wound healing.,"Chronic diabetic wounds are an important healthcare challenge. High concentration glucose, high level of matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), and long-term inflammation constitute the special wound environment of diabetic wounds. Tissue necrosis aggravates the formation of irregular wounds. All the above factors hinder the healing of chronic diabetic wounds. To solve these issues, a glucose and MMP-9 dual-response temperature-sensitive shape self-adaptive hydrogel (CBP/GMs@Cel&INS) was designed and constructed with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and chitosan grafted with phenylboric acid (CS-BA) by encapsulating insulin (INS) and gelatin microspheres containing celecoxib (GMs@Cel). Temperature-sensitive self-adaptive CBP/GMs@Cel&INS provides a new way to balance the fluid-like mobility (self-adapt to deep wounds quickly, approximately 37 °C) and solid-like elasticity (protect wounds against external forces, approximately 25 °C) of self-adaptive hydrogels, while simultaneously releasing insulin and celecoxib on-demand in the environment of high-level glucose and MMP-9. Moreover, CBP/GMs@Cel&INS exhibits remodeling and self-healing properties, enhanced adhesion strength (39.65 ± 6.58 kPa), down-regulates MMP-9, and promotes cell proliferation, migration, and glucose consumption. In diabetic full-thickness skin defect models, CBP/GMs@Cel&INS significantly alleviates inflammation and regulates the local high-level glucose and MMP-9 in the wounds, and promotes wound healing effectively through the synergistic effect of temperature-sensitive shape-adaptive character and the dual-responsive system.",Bioactive materials,eng,2022,Nov
Recent Advances in Electronic Skins with Multiple-Stimuli-Responsive and Self-Healing Abilities.,"Wearable electronic skin (e-skin) has provided a revolutionized way to intelligently sense environmental stimuli, which shows prospective applications in health monitoring, artificial intelligence and prosthetics fields. Drawn inspiration from biological skins, developing e-skin with multiple stimuli perception and self-healing abilities not only enrich their bionic multifunctionality, but also greatly improve their sensory performance and functional stability. In this review, we highlight recent important developments in the material structure design strategy to imitate the fascinating functionalities of biological skins, including molecular synthesis, physical structure design, and special biomimicry engineering. Moreover, their specific structure-property relationships, multifunctional application, and existing challenges are also critically analyzed with representative examples. Furthermore, a summary and perspective on future directions and challenges of biomimetic electronic skins regarding function construction will be briefly discussed. We believe that this review will provide valuable guidance for readers to fabricate superior e-skin materials or devices with skin-like multifunctionalities and disparate characteristics.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Feb
Self-Healing Functional Electronic Devices.,"Electronic devices with various functions bring great convenience and revolutionize the way we live. They are inevitable to degrade over time because of physical or chemical fatigue and damage during practical operation. To make these devices have the ability to autonomously heal from cracks and restore their mechanical and electrical properties, self-healing materials emerged as the time requires for constructing robust and self-healing electronic devices. Here the development of self-healing electronic devices with different functions, for example, energy harvesting, energy storage, sensing, and transmission, is reviewed. The new application scenarios and existing challenges are explored, and possible strategies and perspectives for future practical applications are discussed.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",eng,2021,Oct
Construction of Self-Healing Disulfide-Linked Silicone Elastomers by Thiol Oxidation Coupling Reaction.,"Developing self-healing silicone elastomers are highly significant because of their promising applications. Herein, we present novel self-healing disulfide-linked silicone elastomers (SEs) based on thiol-terminated sulfur-containing heterochain polysiloxanes (P-SHs) and three thiol-containing crosslinkers, including pentaerythritol tetrakis(β-mercaptopropionate) (PETMP), octa(3-mercaptopropyl)silsesquioxane (POSS-SH), and poly[(mercaptopropyl)methylsiloxane] (PMMS), via the thiol oxidation coupling reactions. The construction of these SEs can rapidly proceed at room temperature. The effects of crosslinker species and amounts on the formability and mechanical properties were investigated. The silicone elastomers can be self-healed by heating at 150 °C for 2 h or under UV radiation for 30 min after cutting them into pieces and the self-healing efficiency is >70%. Moreover, they can be utilized as adhesives for bonding glass sheets, which can hold a 200 g weight. The bonding is reversible and can repeatedly proceed many times, indicating that these materials can promisingly be applied as reversible adhesives. These results indicate that a thiol oxidation coupling reaction is a simple and effective strategy for the construction of self-healing disulfide-linked elastomers. Under this strategy, more disulfide-linked organic elastomers with self-healing properties can be designed and constructed and their applications can be further explored.",Polymers,eng,2021,Oct
CuAAC-Based Click Chemistry in Self-Healing Polymers.,"Click chemistry has emerged as a significant tool for materials science, organic chemistry, and bioscience. Based on the initial concept of Barry Sharpless in 2001, the copper(I)-catalyzed azide/alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction has triggered a plethora of chemical concepts for linking molecules and building blocks under ambient conditions, forming the basis for applications in autonomous cross-linking materials. Self-healing systems on the other hand are often based on mild cross-linking chemistries that are able to react either autonomously or upon an external trigger. In the ideal case, self-healing takes place efficiently at low temperatures, independent of the substrate(s) used, by forming strong and stable networks, binding to the newly generated (cracked) interfaces to restore the original material properties. The use of the CuAAC in self-healing systems, most of all the careful design of copper-based catalysts linked to additives as well as the chemical diversity of substrates, has led to an enormous potential of applications of this singular reaction. The implementation of click-based strategies in self-healing systems therefore is highly attractive, as here chemical (and physical) concepts of molecular reactivity, molecular design, and even metal catalysis are connected to aspects of materials science. In this Account, we will show how CuAAC reactions of multivalent components can be used as a tool for self-healing materials, achieving cross-linking at low temperatures (exploiting concepts of autocatalysis or internal chelation within the bulk CuAAC and systematic optimization of the efficiency of the used Cu(I) catalysts). Encapsulation strategies to separate the click components by micro- and nanoencapsulation are required in this context. Consequently, the examples reported here describe chemical concepts to realize more efficient and faster click reactions in self-healing polymeric materials. Thus, enhanced chain diffusion in (hyper)branched polymers, autocatalysis, or internal chelation concepts enable efficient click cross-linking already at 5 °C with a simultaneously reduced amount of Cu(I) catalyst and increased reaction rates, culminating in the first reported self-healing system based on click cycloaddition reactions. Via tailor-made nanocarbon/Cu(I) catalysts we can further improve the click cross-linking reaction in view of efficiency and kinetics, leading to the generation of self-healing graphene-based epoxy nanocomposites. Additionally, we have designed special CuAAC click methods for chemical reporting and visualization systems based on the detection of ruptured capsules via a fluorogenic click reaction, which can be combined with CuAAC cross-linking reactions to obtain simultaneous stress detection and self-healing within polymeric materials. In a similar concept, we have prepared polymeric Cu(I)-biscarbene complexes to detect (mechanical) stress within self-healing polymeric materials via a triggered fluorogenic reaction, thus using a destructive force for a constructive chemical response.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2017,Oct
Progress in self-healing hydrogels assembled by host-guest interactions: preparation and biomedical applications.,"Self-healing is one of the most fundamental properties of living tissues that allows them to withstand repeated damage. Self-healing hydrogels, which can spontaneously recover themselves after being ruptured, result in enhanced lifetimes for materials and open up a fascinating direction in materials science. Host-guest interactions have been widely used in the construction of self-healing hydrogels. We have emphasized the preparation and biomedical applications of self-healing hydrogels assembled by host-guest interactions, focusing on hosts of cyclodextrins and cucurbit[n]urils with various guests and tailored structures. The applications of self-healing hydrogels in biomedical fields such as drug delivery, encapsulation of cells and tissue engineering and 3D printing as well as interfacial adhesion were also summarized.

Mechanical Characteristics and Self-Healing Soil-Cementitious Hydrogel Materials in Mine Backfill Using Hybridized ANFIS-SVM.,"The compressive strength, shrinkage, elasticity, and electrical resistivity of the cement-soil pastes (slag, fly ash) of self-healing of cementitious concrete have been studied while adding hydrogels with nano silica (NSi) in this research. Defining the hydraulic and mechanical properties of these materials requires improvement to motivate more uptake for new buildings. Initially, examining the impact of different synthesized hydrogels on cement-soil pastes showed that solid particles in the mixtures highly affected the absorption capacity of NSi, representing the importance of direct interactions between solid particles and hydrogels in a cementitious matrix. All test results were analyzed by use of a hybridized soft computing model such as the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector regression (SVR) for precise studying and the avoidance of few empirical tests or error percentages. Subsequently, the best RMSE of ANFIS is 0.6568 and the best RMSE of SVM is 1.2564; the RMSE of ANFIS-SVM (0.5643) in the test phase is also close to zero, showing a better performance in hypothesizing self-healing soil-cementitious hydrogel materials in mine backfill. The R2 value for ANFIS-SVM is 0.9547, proving that it is a proper model for predicting the study's goal. Electrical resistivity and compressive strength declined in the cement-soil pastes including hydrogels according to experimental outcomes; it was lowered by the increase of NSi concentration in the hydrogel. There was a decrement in the autogenous shrinkage of cement-soil pastes while adding hydrogel, depending on the NSi concentration in the hydrogels. The findings of this research are pivotal for the internal curing of cementitious materials to define the absorption of hydrogels.","Gels (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Jul
Principles and Applications of Ultrasonic-Based Nondestructive Methods for Self-Healing in Cementitious Materials.,"Recently, self-healing technologies have emerged as a promising approach to extend the service life of social infrastructure in the field of concrete construction. However, current evaluations of the self-healing technologies developed for cementitious materials are mostly limited to lab-scale experiments to inspect changes in surface crack width (by optical microscopy) and permeability. Furthermore, there is a universal lack of unified test methods to assess the effectiveness of self-healing technologies. Particularly, with respect to the self-healing of concrete applied in actual construction, nondestructive test methods are required to avoid interrupting the use of the structures under evaluation. This paper presents a review of all existing research on the principles of ultrasonic test methods and case studies pertaining to self-healing concrete. The main objective of the study is to examine the applicability and limitation of various ultrasonic test methods in assessing the self-healing performance. Finally, future directions on the development of reliable assessment methods for self-healing cementitious materials are suggested.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2017,Mar
Transformation of Construction Cement to a Self-Healing Hybrid Binder.,"A new biomimetic strategy to im prove the self-healing properties of Portland cement is presented that is based on the application of the biogenic inorganic polymer polyphosphate (polyP), which is used as a cement admixture. The data show that synthetic linear polyp, with an average chain length of 40, as well as natural long-chain polyP isolated from soil bacteria, has the ability to support self-healing of this construction material. Furthermore, polyP, used as a water-soluble Na-salt, is subject to Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchange by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the cement, resulting in the formation of a water-rich coacervate when added to the cement surface, especially to the surface of bacteria-containing cement/concrete samples. The addition of polyP in low concentrations (<1% on weight basis for the solids) not only accelerated the hardening of cement/concrete but also the healing of microcracks present in the material. The results suggest that long-chain polyP is a promising additive that increases the self-healing capacity of cement by mimicking a bacteria-mediated natural mechanism.",International journal of molecular sciences,eng,2019,Jun
Advanced self-healing asphalt composites in the pavement performance field: mechanisms at the nano level and new repairing methodologies.,"In an effort to give a global view of this field of research, in this mini-review we highlight the most recent publications and patents focusing on modified asphalt pavements that contain certain reinforcing nanoparticles which impart desirable thermal, electrical and mechanical properties. In response to the increasing cost of asphalt binder and road maintenance, there is a need to look for alternative technologies and new asphalt composites, able to self-repair, for preserving and renewing the existing pavements. First, we will focus on the self-healing property of asphalt, the evidences that support that healing takes place immediately after the contact between the faces of a crack, and how the amount of healing can be measured in both the laboratory and the field. Next we review the hypothetical mechanisms of healing to understand the material behaviour and establish models to quantify the damage-healing process. Thereafter, we outline different technologies, nanotechnologies and methodologies used for self-healing paying particular attention to embedded micro-capsules, new nano-materials like carbon nanotubes and nano-fibres, ionomers, and microwave and induction heating processes.",Recent patents on nanotechnology,eng,2015,No Data
Recent advances in self-healing polyurethane based on dynamic covalent bonds combined with other self-healing methods.,"To meet more application requirements, improving mechanical properties and self-healing efficiency has become the focus of current research on self-healing PU.

"High-stretchable, self-healing, self-adhesive, self-extinguishing, low-temperature tolerant starch-based gel and its application in stimuli-responsiveness.","Starch with active hydroxyl groups is one of the most attractive carbohydrates for the preparation of gels in recent years. However, the mechanical properties, self-healing properties, self-adhesion properties, especially low-temperature resistance are generally unsatisfactory for current starch-based gels. Based on that, a multiple network structure of amylopectin-carboxymethyl cellulose-polyacrylamide (ACP) gel was prepared by a ""cooking"" method. Tannic acid (TA) was used to construct multiple hydrogen bonds among molecular chains. ACP gel demonstrates high elongation at break (1090 %) and strength, self-healing performance and adhesion behavior, extraordinary low-temperature resistance (-80 °C) and self-extinguishing. As a sensor device, ACP gel can effectively monitor human movements and microscopic expression changes and achieve real-time monitoring under harsh conditions (After multiple cutting-healing steps, under low-temperature conditions, even a month later). Additionally, ACP gel could be served to detect temperature changes with a wide operating range and a high sensitivity of 33 %·°C<sup>-1</sup>, which is promising to monitor the changes in temperature. More interestingly, ACP gel can even monitor the cooking process and breathing frequency with fast response, implying applications in food processing, disease diagnosis and medical treatment.

Evaluation of Internal and Superficial Self-Healing of Cracks in Concrete with Crystalline Admixtures.,"Reinforced concrete structures are prone to cracking. The development of cementitious matrices with the capacity for self-healing soon after these cracks appear represents savings with inspections and repairs of the structures. Self-healing can be stimulated with the use of crystalline admixtures. Such materials easily react with water and increase the density of C-S-H (hydrated-calcium-silicate), forming insoluble deposits blocking existing pores and cracks. In this research, self-healing in concrete cracks was evaluated using three different crystalline admixtures, submitted to two and six wetting-drying cycles. The efficiency of self-healing was evaluated by optical microscopy and using the chloride diffusion test, which allowed calculating the predicted useful life of the concretes. The results highlight two important findings: (i) in optical microscopy, crystalline admixtures were not efficient in promoting self-healing on the surface of cracks in any of the studied concretes; (ii) the passage of chlorides by diffusion was lower for concretes with crystalline admixtures compared to the reference, showing better internal healing of these materials and, consequently, greater prediction of the concrete's useful life.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Nov
Distinct Mechanical and Self-Healing Properties in Two Polydimethylsiloxane Coordination Polymers with Fine-Tuned Bond Strength.,"Coordination bonds are effective for constructing highly efficient self-healing materials as their strength is highly tunable. To design self-healing polymers with better performance, it is important to get a profound understanding of the structure-property relationships. However, this is challenging for self-healing polymers based on coordination bonds, because many parameters, such as bond energy, bond dynamics, and coordination number will have an essential effect on the mechanical and self-healing properties of the polymer. In this work, we synthesized two poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) polymers cross-linked by different Zn(II)-diiminopyridine coordination complexes (denoted as PDMS-NNN-Zn, PDMS-MeNNN-Zn respectively). The two cross-linking Zn(II)-diiminopyridine complexes are similar in coordination modes, but differ in coordination dynamics. As manifested by ITC, rheology, and tensile experiments, we confirm that the coordination bond in PDMS-MeNNN-Zn polymer films is weaker but more dynamic. Consequently, the PDMS-MeNNN-Zn polymer has poorer mechanical strength but higher stretchability and better self-healing properties. The inflicted cracks on PDMS-MeNNN-Zn polymer films can be completely healed after healing at room temperature for only 30 min with healing efficiencies higher than 90%. Such fast self-healing properties have never been achieved in self-healing polymers based on coordination bonds. Our results also demonstrate the important impact of the thermodynamic stability and kinetic lability of coordination complexes on the mechanical and self-healing properties of polymers. Such a comprehensive understanding is helpful for further design of novel synthetic polymers, which can achieve an optimal balance between the mechanical strength and self-healing performance.",Inorganic chemistry,eng,2018,Mar
Self-Healing Polymers Based on Coordination Bonds.,"Self-healing ability is an important survival feature in nature, with which living beings can spontaneously repair damage when wounded. Inspired by nature, people have designed and synthesized many self-healing materials by encapsulating healing agents or incorporating reversible covalent bonds or noncovalent interactions into a polymer matrix. Among the noncovalent interactions, the coordination bond is demonstrated to be effective for constructing highly efficient self-healing polymers. Moreover, with the presence of functional metal ions or ligands and dynamic metal-ligand bonds, self-healing polymers can show various functions such as dielectrics, luminescence, magnetism, catalysis, stimuli-responsiveness, and shape-memory behavior. Herein, the recent developments and achievements made in the field of self-healing polymers based on coordination bonds are presented.

In this study, in situ forming, injectable, macroporous, self-healing gelatin (GE)/oxidized alginate (OSA)/adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) hydrogels were prepared using a high-speed shearing treatment and were stabilized by Schiff base reaction and acylhydrazone bonds. Their injectability, self-healing ability, rheology, microstructure, equilibrium water content, and in vitro biodegradation were investigated. We found that the injectable GE/OSA/ADH precursors remained in a liquid form and flowed easily for several minutes at room temperature, but however, gelled rapidly at body temperature. The gelation time could be regulated by varying the ratio of GE, OSA, and ADH. The obtained hydrogels had an interconnected macroporous structure and self-healing ability. The porosity of hydrogels was in the range of approximately 60-83%, and pore size varied from approximately 125-380 μm. The porous structure of hydrogel was visualized by field-emission scanning electron microscope, micro-computed tomography, and laser confocal microscope. Human epidermal growth factor was loaded by in situ mixing in GE/OSA/ADH hydrogels and was released with good bioactivity as evaluated by ELISA. Moreover, L929 cells proliferated on GE/OSA/ADH hydrogels, as verified by Cell Counting Kit-8 and LIVE/DEAD assays. Furthermore, encapsulation of NIH 3T3 cells within GE/OSA/ADH hydrogels demonstrated that the hydrogel can support cell survival, proliferation, and migration. In vivo studies showed that the hydrogels had a good injectability, in situ gelation, and tissue biocompatibility. Therefore, GE/OSA/ADH hydrogel represented a novel and safe injectable macroporous self-healing hydrogel for tissue engineering scaffold and drug delivery vehicle purposes.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2018,Oct
Application of microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation in designing bio self-healing concrete.,"Concrete is one of the most broadly used construction materials in the world due to its number of performance characteristics. Despite the long life of concrete structure under ideal conditions, it tends to crack and this phenomenon results in a considerable reduction in service life and performance. Evidence of microbial involvement in the precipitation of minerals has led to a massive investigation on adapting this technology for addressing the concrete cracking issue. Calcium carbonate is one of most compatible materials with the concrete constituents and it can be induced via biological process. In this review paper, the effects of different factors, such as nucleation site, pH, nutrient and temperature, on the biosynthesis of calcium carbonate are elucidated. Moreover, the influences of effective factors on calcium carbonate polymorphism are extensively elaborated.

Recycling industrial wastes into self-healing concrete: A review.,"Self-healing concrete is an innovative construction material designed to repair its cracks autogenously or autonomously. The self-healing effect reduces the need for maintenance and increases the longevity of concrete structures, bringing environmental and economic benefits. However, the developed methods to improve self-healing performance, e.g., incorporating advanced techniques or expensive chemical healing agents, significantly increase the cost of concrete manufacture. There is worldwide interest in using waste materials to reduce the cost of self-healing concrete, and a significant amount of studies have been performed on this topic. A review of research on waste-derived self-healing concrete is presented in this paper. The wastes were used in both autogenous and autonomous self-healing approaches, such as mineral admixture, bacteria-based technology, and engineered cementitious composite; different environmental conditions may significantly influence self-healing efficiency due to different reaction mechanisms. In general, waste materials could be reused to manufacture self-healing concrete if adopting appropriate mix design and treatment methods. Self-healing concrete made with various industrial wastes is an efficient way to reduce the manufacturing cost and promote its application in practice.",Environmental research,eng,2022,Nov
"Fluorescent, electrically responsive and ultratough self-healing hydrogels <i>via</i> bioinspired all-in-one hierarchical micelles.","Intelligent hydrogels that simultaneously exhibit excellent toughness, self-healing ability and photoelectronic responsiveness are in high demand but are greatly challenging to prepare.

First Large Scale Application with Self-Healing Concrete in Belgium: Analysis of the Laboratory Control Tests.,"Due to the negative impact of construction processes on the environment and a decrease in investments, there is a need for concrete structures to operate longer while maintaining their high performance. Self-healing concrete has the ability to heal itself when it is cracked, thereby protecting the interior matrix as well as the reinforcement steel, resulting in an increased service life. Most research has focused on mortar specimens at lab-scale. Yet, to demonstrate the feasibility of applying self-healing concrete in practice, demonstrators of large-scale applications are necessary. A roof slab of an inspection pit was cast with bacterial self-healing concrete and is now in normal operation. As a bacterial additive to the concrete, a mixture called MUC+, made out of a Mixed Ureolytic Culture together with anaerobic granular bacteria, was added to the concrete during mixing. This article reports on the tests carried out on laboratory control specimens made from the same concrete batch, as well as the findings of an inspection of the roof slab under operating conditions. Lab tests showed that cracks at the bottom of specimens and subjected to wet/dry cycles had the best visual crack closure. Additionally, the sealing efficiency of cracked specimens submersed for 27 weeks in water, measured by means of a water permeability setup, was at least equal to 90%, with an efficiency of at least 98.5% for the largest part of the specimens. An inspection of the roof slab showed no signs of cracking, yet favorable conditions for healing were observed. So, despite the high healing potential that was recorded during lab experiments, an assessment under real-life conditions was not yet possible.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Feb

Self-healing soft pneumatic robots.,"Inspired by the compliance found in many organisms, soft robots are made almost entirely out of flexible, soft material, making them suitable for applications in uncertain, dynamic task environments, including safe human-robot interactions. Their intrinsic compliance absorbs shocks and protects them against mechanical impacts. However, the soft materials used for their construction are highly susceptible to damage, such as cuts and perforations caused by sharp objects present in the uncontrolled and unpredictable environments they operate in. In this research, we propose to construct soft robotics entirely out of self-healing elastomers. On the basis of healing capacities found in nature, these polymers are given the ability to heal microscopic and macroscopic damage. Diels-Alder polymers, being thermoreversible covalent networks, were used to develop three applications of self-healing soft pneumatic actuators (a soft gripper, a soft hand, and artificial muscles). Soft pneumatic actuators commonly experience perforations and leaks due to excessive pressures or wear during operation. All three prototypes were designed using finite element modeling and mechanically characterized. The manufacturing method of the actuators exploits the self-healing behavior of the materials, which can be recycled. Realistic macroscopic damage could be healed entirely using a mild heat treatment. At the location of the scar, no weak spots were created, and the full performance of the actuators was nearly completely recovered after healing.",Science robotics,eng,2017,Aug
Self-healing of early age cracks in cement-based materials by mineralization of carbonic anhydrase microorganism.,"This research investigated the self-healing potential of early age cracks in cement-based materials incorporating the bacteria which can produce carbonic anhydrase. Cement-based materials specimens were pre-cracked at the age of 7, 14, 28, 60 days to study the repair ability influenced by cracking time, the width of cracks were between 0.1 and 1.0 mm to study the healing rate influenced by width of cracks. The experimental results indicated that the bacteria showed excellent repairing ability to small cracks formed at early age of 7 days, cracks below 0.4 mm was almost completely closed. The repair effect reduced with the increasing of cracking age. Cracks width influenced self-healing effectiveness significantly. The transportation of CO2and Ca(2+) controlled the self-healing process.

Performance of Epoxy Resin Polymer as Self-Healing Cementitious Materials Agent in Mortar.,"This research investigated the application of epoxy resin polymer as a self-healing strategy for improving the mechanical and durability properties of cement-based mortar. The epoxy resin was added to the concrete mix at various levels (5, 10, 15, and 20% of cement weight), and the effectiveness of healing was evaluated by microstructural analysis, compressive strength, and non-destructive (ultrasonic pulse velocity) tests. Dry and wet-dry conditions were considered for curing, and for generating artificial cracks, specimens at different curing ages (1 and 6 months) were subjected to compressive testing (50 and 80% of specimen's ultimate compressive strength). The results indicated that the mechanical properties in the specimen prepared by 10% epoxy resin and cured under wet-dry conditions was higher compared to other specimens. The degree of damage and healing efficiency index of this particular mix design were significantly affected by the healing duration and cracking age. An optimized artificial neural network (ANN) combined with a firefly algorithm was developed to estimate these indexes over the self-healing process. Overall, it was concluded that the epoxy resin polymer has high potential as a mechanical properties self-healing agent in cement-based mortar.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Mar
Analytical model for effects of capsule shape on the healing efficiency in self-healing materials.,"The fundamental requirement for the autonomous capsule-based self-healing process to work is that cracks need to reach the capsules and break them such that the healing agent can be released. Ignoring all other aspects, the amount of healing agents released into the crack is essential to obtain a good healing. Meanwhile, from the perspective of the capsule shapes, spherical or elongated capsules (hollow tubes/fibres) are the main morphologies used in capsule-based self-healing materials. The focus of this contribution is the description of the effects of capsule shape on the efficiency of healing agent released in capsule-based self-healing material within the framework of the theory of geometrical probability and integral geometry. Analytical models are developed to characterize the amount of healing agent released per crack area from capsules for an arbitrary crack intersecting with capsules of various shapes in a virtual capsule-based self-healing material. The average crack opening distance is chosen to be a key parameter in defining the healing potential of individual cracks in the models. Furthermore, the accuracy of the developed models was verified by comparison to the data from a published numerical simulation study.",PloS one,eng,2017,No Data
An in situ and rapid self-healing strategy enabling a stretchable nanocomposite with extremely durable and highly sensitive sensing features.,"Progress toward the development of wearable electromechanical sensors with durable and reliable sensing performance is critical for emerging wearable integrated electronic applications. However, it remains a long-standing challenge to realize mechanically stretchable sensing materials with extremely durable and high-performing sensing ability due to the fundamental dilemma lying in the sensing mechanism. In this work, we proposed an in situ and rapid self-healing strategy through nano-confining a dynamic host-guest supramolecular polymer network in a graphene-based multilevel nanocomposite matrix to fabricate a mechanically stretchable and structurally healable sensing nanocomposite which is provided with intriguing sensing durability and sensitivity simultaneously. When repeatedly stretching and releasing the nanocomposite sensing film, the fast association kinetics of cyclodextrin and adamantane host-guest inclusion complexes and good polymer chain dynamics in the supramolecular polymer network endowed by the nanoconfinement effect enable autonomous and rapid repair of the micro-cracks in situ generated in the sensing material. As a result, our strain sensing devices can achieve an extremely high durability and retain stable sensing performance even after over 100 000 stretching-releasing cycles at large strain of 50%. Moreover, the brittle nature originated from the inorganically dominated structure in conjunction with the thermodynamically stable host-guest interactions and dynamic hydrogen bonds inside the multilevel nanocomposite allow the sensing material to exhibit an ultrahigh gauge factor over 1500 with a large working strain of 58%.

The Versatility of Polymeric Materials as Self-Healing Agents for Various Types of Applications: A Review.,"The versatility of polymeric materials as healing agents to prevent any structure failure and their ability to restore their initial mechanical properties has attracted interest from many researchers. Various applications of the self-healing polymeric materials are explored in this paper. The mechanism of self-healing, which includes the extrinsic and intrinsic approaches for each of the applications, is examined. The extrinsic mechanism involves the introduction of external healing agents such as microcapsules and vascular networks into the system. Meanwhile, the intrinsic mechanism refers to the inherent reversibility of the molecular interaction of the polymer matrix, which is triggered by the external stimuli. Both self-healing mechanisms have shown a significant impact on the cracked properties of the damaged sites. This paper also presents the different types of self-healing polymeric materials applied in various applications, which include electronics, coating, aerospace, medicals, and construction fields. It is expected that this review gives a significantly broader idea of self-healing polymeric materials and their healing mechanisms in various types of applications.",Polymers,eng,2021,Apr

"5S Multifunctional Intelligent Coating with Superdurable, Superhydrophobic, Self-Monitoring, Self-Heating, and Self-Healing Properties for Existing Construction Application.","There is a constant drive to develop ultra-high-performance multifunctional coatings for existing construction used in modern engineering technologies. For these materials to be used in unsound infrastructure protections, they are required to present enhanced robustness while bearing functionalities to meet multiple uses. Single-function coating is not smart enough to provide satisfactory protection, and the preparation process of multifunctional materials is complex, costly, and provides poor durability. Thus, existing coatings are not suitable to generate an intelligent closed-loop protection system. Herein, we report an innovative 5S multifunctional intelligent coating (5SC) for existing construction materials with superdurable, superhydrophobic, self-monitoring, self-heating, and self-healing properties.

A review on the potential of filamentous fungi for microbial self-healing of concrete.,"Concrete is the most used construction material worldwide due to its abundant availability and inherent ease of manufacturing and application. However, the material bears several drawbacks such as the high susceptibility for crack formation, leading to reinforcement corrosion and structural degradation. Extensive research has therefore been performed on the use of microorganisms for biologically mediated self-healing of concrete by means of CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation. Recently, filamentous fungi have been recognized as high-potential microorganisms for this application as their hyphae grow in an interwoven three-dimensional network which serves as nucleation site for CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation to heal the crack. This potential is corroborated by the current state of the art on fungi-mediated self-healing concrete, which is not yet extensive but valuable to direct further research. In this review, we aim to broaden the perspectives on the use of fungi for concrete self-healing applications by first summarizing the major progress made in the field of microbial self-healing of concrete and then discussing pioneering work that has been done with fungi.

Embedded 3D Printing in Self-Healing Annealable Composites for Precise Patterning of Functionally Mature Human Neural Constructs.,"Human in vitro models of neural tissue with tunable microenvironment and defined spatial arrangement are needed to facilitate studies of brain development and disease. Towards this end, embedded printing inside granular gels holds great promise as it allows precise patterning of extremely soft tissue constructs. However, granular printing support formulations are restricted to only a handful of materials. Therefore, there has been a need for novel materials that take advantage of versatile biomimicry of bulk hydrogels while providing high-fidelity support for embedded printing akin to granular gels. To address this need, Authors present a modular platform for bioengineering of neuronal networks via direct embedded 3D printing of human stem cells inside Self-Healing Annealable Particle-Extracellular matrix (SHAPE) composites.

Toward Self-Healing Concrete Infrastructure: Review of Experiments and Simulations across Scales.,"Cement and concrete are vital materials used to construct durable habitats and infrastructure that withstand natural and human-caused disasters. Still, concrete cracking imposes enormous repair costs on societies, and excessive cement consumption for repairs contributes to climate change. Therefore, the need for more durable cementitious materials, such as those with self-healing capabilities, has become more urgent. In this review, we present the functioning mechanisms of five different strategies for implementing self-healing capability into cement based materials: (1) autogenous self-healing from ordinary portland cement and supplementary cementitious materials and geopolymers in which defects and cracks are repaired through intrinsic carbonation and crystallization; (2) autonomous self-healing by (a) biomineralization wherein bacteria within the cement produce carbonates, silicates, or phosphates to heal damage, (b) polymer-cement composites in which autonomous self-healing occurs both within the polymer and at the polymer-cement interface, and (c) fibers that inhibit crack propagation, thus allowing autogenous healing mechanisms to be more effective. In all cases, we discuss the self-healing agent and synthesize the state of knowledge on the self-healing mechanism(s). In this review article, the state of computational modeling across nano- to macroscales developed based on experimental data is presented for each self-healing approach. We conclude the review by noting that, although autogenous reactions help repair small cracks, the most fruitful opportunities lay within design strategies for additional components that can migrate into cracks and initiate chemistries that retard crack propagation and generate repair of the cement matrix.",Chemical reviews,eng,2023,Sep

Bioconcrete: next generation of self-healing concrete.,"Concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials and has a high tendency to form cracks. These cracks lead to significant reduction in concrete service life and high replacement costs. Although it is not possible to prevent crack formation, various types of techniques are in place to heal the cracks. It has been shown that some of the current concrete treatment methods such as the application of chemicals and polymers are a source of health and environmental risks, and more importantly, they are effective only in the short term.

Feasibility of Using 3D Printed Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) for Creating Self-Healing Vascular Tunnels in Cement System.,"Pursuing long-term self-healing infrastructures has gained popularity in the construction field. Vascular networks have the potential to achieve long-term self-healing in cementitious infrastructures. To avoid further monitoring of non-cementitious tubes, sacrificial material can be used as a way of creating hollow channels. In this research, we report a new method for fabrication of complex 3D internal hollow tunnels using 3D printing of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). The behaviour of 3D printed PVA structures in cement pastes was investigated using computed-tomography (CT) combined with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM/EDX). Results showed that (i) 1300 min were needed to fully dissolve 1 g of a 3D printed PVA structure, and different pH solutions did not significantly change the PVA dissolving process compared with a neutral environment; (ii) a low water/cement ratio can minimize early stage cracking resulting from PVA expansion; (iii) and PVA-cement interaction products were mainly calcite and a Ca-polymer compound. In conclusion, controlling the PVA expansion by decreasing the water/cement (w/c) ratio provides a promising approach to achieve 3D hollow channels in cement and, therefore, makes it possible to create complex tunnels within self-healing cementitious materials.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2019,Nov
Advances in versatile anti-swelling polymer hydrogels.,"Swelling is ubiquitous for traditional as-prepared hydrogels, but is unfavorable in many situations, especially biomedical applications, such as tissue engineering, internal wound closure, soft actuating and bioelectronics, and so forth. As the swelling of a hydrogel usually leads to a volume expansion, which not only deteriorates the mechanical property of the hydrogel but can bring about undesirable oppression on the surrounding tissues when applied in vivo. In contrast, anti-swelling hydrogels hardly alter their volume when applied in aqueous environment, therefore reserving the original mechanical performance and size-stability and facilitating their potential application. In the past decade, with the development of advanced hydrogels, quite a number of anti-swelling hydrogels with versatile functions have been developed by researchers to meet the practical applications well, through integrating anti-swelling property with certain performance or functionality, such as high strength, self-healing, injectability, adhesiveness, antiseptics, etc. However, there has not been a general summary with regard to these hydrogels. To promote the construction of anti-swelling hydrogels with desirable functionalities in the future, this review generalizes and analyzes the tactics employed so far in the design and manufacture of anti-swelling hydrogels, starting from the viewpoint of classical swelling theories.

Current challenges and future directions for bacterial self-healing concrete.,"Microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) has been widely explored and applied in the field of environmental engineering over the last decade. Calcium carbonate is naturally precipitated as a byproduct of various microbial metabolic activities. This biological process was brought into practical use to restore construction materials, strengthen and remediate soil, and sequester carbon. MICP has also been extensively examined for applications in self-healing concrete. Biogenic crack repair helps mitigate the high maintenance costs of concrete in an eco-friendly manner. In this process, calcium carbonate precipitation (CCP)-capable bacteria and nutrients are embedded inside the concrete. These bacteria are expected to increase the durability of the concrete by precipitating calcium carbonate in situ to heal cracks that develop in the concrete. However, several challenges exist with respect to embedding such bacteria; harsh conditions in concrete matrices are unsuitable for bacterial life, including high alkalinity (pH up to 13), high temperatures during manufacturing processes, and limited oxygen supply. Additionally, many biological factors, including the optimum conditions for MICP, the molecular mechanisms involved in MICP, the specific microorganisms suitable for application in concrete, the survival characteristics of the microorganisms embedded in concrete, and the amount of MICP in concrete, remain unclear. In this paper, metabolic pathways that result in conditions favorable for calcium carbonate precipitation, current and potential applications in concrete, and the remaining biological challenges are reviewed.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2018,Apr
Self-Healing Approach toward Catalytic Soft Robots.,"Soft robotics is a rapidly evolving research field that focuses on developing robots with bioinspired actuation/sensing mechanisms and highly flexible soft materials, some of which are similar to those found in living organisms. The hydrogel has the characteristics of excellent biocompatibility, softness, and elasticity, which makes it an ideal candidate material for the preparation of soft robots. Here we utilized a self-healing approach to develop a catalytically driven soft robot, which was constructed by dynamic imine bonds between modular hydrogels. One of the modules was a hydrogel formed by dynamic aldimine cross-linking of chitosan and glutaraldehyde, and the other module was a hydrogel embedded with catalase. The soft hydrogel robot moved because of catalytic reactions between the robot and environment [hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) fuel], giving rise to a fluidic release that supports propulsion, as inspired by the jet-propulsive mechanism in swimming dragonfly larvae. The speed of the soft robot can be mediated by adjusting the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and enable/disable movement based on the folding and unfolding of enzymes. In addition, the hydrogel formed by replacing glutaraldehyde with dialdehyde-functionalized PEG<sub>2000</sub> had excellent elastic properties, and the soft robot based on PEG<sub>2000</sub> had a higher movement speed than that based on glutaraldehyde under the same H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentration. Moreover, the addition of iron oxide nanoparticles can realize the magnetic guidance of the soft robot and the combination of different modules can realize different motion modes. The highly configurable self-healing catalytic soft robot holds great potential for a variety of interesting applications, including swimming robots, robot-assisted water treatment, and drug release.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Sep

Biochemical process of ureolysis-based microbial CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation and its application in self-healing concrete.,"Urea hydrolysis has already been considered as the most effective pathway for microbially induced CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation (MICP). The present work first studied the combination of several key factors including initial pH, temperature, and dosage of urea, which contribute to the biochemical process of MICP. Under an amiable condition of pH and temperature, the dosage of urea has a significant impact on the rate of urea degradation and CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation. A bacteria-based self-healing system was developed by loading healing agents on ceramsite carriers. The self-healing efficiency was evaluated by visual inspection on crack closure, compressive strength regain, and capillary water absorption. A preferable healing effectiveness was obtained when the bacteria and organic nutrients were co-immobilized in carriers. Image analysis showed that cracks up to 273 μm could be healed with a crack closure ratio of 86% in 28 days. The compressive strength regain increased 24% and the water absorption coefficient decreased 27% compared to the reference. The findings indicated a promising application of ureolysis-based MICP in restoring the mechanical properties and enhancing the durability of concrete.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2018,Apr
Improving the Self-Healing of Cementitious Materials with a Hydrogel System.,"Despite cement's superior performance and inexpensive cost compared to other industrial materials, crack development remains a persistent problem in concrete. Given the comparatively low tensile strength, when cracks emerge, a pathway is created for gas and water to enter the cementitious matrix, resulting in steel reinforcement corrosion which compromises the durability of concrete. Superabsorbent hydrogels have been developed as a novel material for enhancing the characteristics of cementitious materials in which they have been demonstrated to decrease autogenous shrinkage and encourage self-healing. This study will detail the design and application of polyelectrolyte hydrogel particles as internal curing agents in concrete and provide new findings on relevant hydrogel-ion interactions. When hydrogel particles are mixed into concrete, they generate their stored water to fuel the curing reaction that results in less cracking and shrinkage, thereby prolonging the service life of the concrete. The interaction of hydrogels with cementitious materials is addressed in this study; the effect of hydrogels on the characteristics and self-healing of cementitious materials was also studied. Incorporating hydrogel particles into cement decreased mixture shrinkage while increasing the production of particular inorganic phases within the vacuum region formerly supplied by the swollen particle. In addition, considering the control paste, cement pastes containing hydrogels exhibited less autogenous shrinkage. The influence of hydrogels on autogenous shrinkage was found to be chemically dependent; the hydrogel with a delayed desorption rate displayed significantly low shrinkage in cement paste.","Gels (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Apr
Quantum Dots-Loaded Self-Healing Gels for Versatile Fluorescent Assembly.,"From the perspective of applied science, methods that allow the simple construction of versatile quantum dots (QDs)-loaded gels are highly desirable. In this work, we report the self-healing assembly methods for various fluorescent QDs-loaded gels. Firstly, we employed horizontal frontal polymerization (FP) to fabricate self-healing gels within several minutes using a rapid and energy-saving means of preparation. The as-prepared gels showed pH sensitivity, satisfactory mechanical properties and excellent self-healing properties and the healing efficiency reached 90%. The integration of the QDs with the gels allowed the generation of fluorescent composites, which were successfully applied to an LED device. In addition, by using the self-healing QDs-loaded gels as building blocks, the self-healing assembly method was used to construct complex structures with different fluorescence, which could then be used for sensing and encoding. This work offers a new perspective on constructing various fluorescent assemblies by self-healing assembly, and it might stimulate the future application of self-healing gels in a self-healing assembly fashion.","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Jan
Construction and mechanism study of lignin-based polyurethane with high strength and high self-healing properties.,"Lignin is a natural polymer with abundant functional groups with great application prospects in lignin-based polyurethane elastomers with self-healing abilities. In this study, a lignin self-healing polyurethane (PUDA-L) was specially designed using lignin as the raw material of polyurethane, combining lignin with Diels-Alder (DA) bond and hydrogen bonds. The experimental results showed that PUDA-L was prepared with good thermal stability, fatigue resistance, shape memory effect, excellent mechanical strength, and self-healing ability by partially replacing the crosslinking agents with bio-based lignin and hydroxylated modified lignin to increase the hydroxyl content. Polyurethane has a tensile strength of up to 29 MPa and an elongation at break of up to 500 %. The excellent self-healing ability of PUDA-L originates from the internal DA bonds and cross-linked hydrogen bonds. After the dumbbell sample was fused and heated at 130 °C for 4 h, the elastomer could be completely healed, the tensile strength was restored to 29 MPa, and the self-healing efficiency was up to 100 %. The developed PUDA-L elastomer has promising applications in sensors and smart skins.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2023,Sep
A Review on Cementitious Self-Healing and the Potential of Phase-Field Methods for Modeling Crack-Closing and Fracture Recovery.,"Improving the durability and sustainability of concrete structures has been driving the enormous number of research papers on self-healing mechanisms that have been published in the past decades. The vast developments of computer science significantly contributed to this and enhanced the various possibilities numerical simulations can offer to predict the entire service life, with emphasis on crack development and cementitious self-healing. The aim of this paper is to review the currently available literature on numerical methods for cementitious self-healing and fracture development using Phase-Field (PF) methods. The PF method is a computational method that has been frequently used for modeling and predicting the evolution of meso- and microstructural morphology of cementitious materials. It uses a set of conservative and non-conservative field variables to describe the phase evolutions. Unlike traditional sharp interface models, these field variables are continuous in the interfacial region, which is typical for PF methods. The present study first summarizes the various principles of self-healing mechanisms for cementitious materials, followed by the application of PF methods for simulating microscopic phase transformations. Then, a review on the various PF approaches for precipitation reaction and fracture mechanisms is reported, where the final section addresses potential key issues that may be considered in future developments of self-healing models. This also includes unified, combined and coupled multi-field models, which allow a comprehensive simulation of self-healing processes in cementitious materials.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Nov
Additive Manufacturing for Self-Healing Soft Robots.,"The field of self-healing soft robots was initiated a few years ago. A healing ability can be integrated in soft robots by manufacturing their soft membranes out of synthetic self-healing polymers, more specifically elastomeric Diels-Alder (DA) networks. As such they can recover completely from macroscopic damage, including scratches, cuts, and ruptures. Before this research, these robots were manufactured using a technique named ""shaping-through-folding-and-self-healing."" This technique requires extensive manual labor, is relatively slow, and does not allow for complex shapes. In this article, an additive manufacturing methodology, fused filament fabrication, is developed for the thermoreversible DA polymers, and the approach is validated on a soft robotic gripper. The reversibility of their network permits manufacturing these flexible self-healing polymers through reactive printing into the complex shapes required in soft robotics. The degree of freedom in the design of soft robotics that this new manufacturing technique offers is illustrated through the construction of adaptive DHAS gripper fingers, based on the design by FESTO. Being constructed out of self-healing soft flexible polymer, the fingers can recover entirely from large cuts, tears, and punctures. This is highlighted through various damage-heal cycles.",Soft robotics,eng,2020,Dec
Evaluation of Microencapsulation Techniques for MICP Bacterial Spores Applied in Self-Healing Concrete.,"Concrete cracks must be repaired promptly in order to prevent structural damage and to prolong the structural life of the building (or other such construction). Biological self-healing concrete is a recent alternative technology involving the biochemical reaction of microbial induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). This study determined the most appropriate technique to encapsulate spores of Bacillus sphaericus LMG 22257 with sodium alginate so as to protect the bacterial spores during the concrete mixing and hardening period. Three techniques (extrusion, spray drying and freeze drying) to encapsulate the bacterial spores with sodium alginate were evaluated. The freeze-drying process provided the highest bacterial spore survival rate (100%), while the extruded and spray-dried processes had a lower spore survival rate of 93.8% and 79.9%, respectively. To investigate the viability of microencapsulated spores after being mixed with mortar, the decomposed urea analysis was conducted. The results revealed that the freeze-dried spores also showed the highest level of urea decomposition (metabolic activity assay used as a surrogate marker of spore germination and vegetative cell viability). Thus, the self-healing performance of concrete mixed with freeze-dried spores was evaluated. The results showed that the crack healing ratio observed from the mortar specimens with freeze-dried microencapsulated spores were significantly higher than those without bacteria. This study revealed that freeze drying has a high potential as a microencapsulation technique for application to self-healing concrete technology.",Scientific reports,eng,2019,Aug
3D-Printed Self-Healing Elastomers for Modular Soft Robotics.,"Advances in materials, designs, and controls are propelling the field of soft robotics at an incredible rate; however, current methods for prototyping soft robots remain cumbersome and struggle to incorporate desirable geometric complexity. Herein, a vat photopolymerizable self-healing elastomer system capable of extreme elongations up to 1000% is presented. The material is formed from a combination of thiol/acrylate mixed chain/step-growth polymerizations and uses a combination of physical processes and dynamic-bond exchange via thioethers to achieve full self-healing capacity over multiple damage/healing cycles. These elastomers can be three dimensional (3D) printed with modular designs capable of healing together to form highly complex and large functional soft robots. Additionally, these materials show reprogrammable resting shapes and compatibility with self-healing liquid metal electronics. Using these capabilities, subcomponents with multiple internal channel systems were printed, healed together, and combined with functional liquid metals to form a high-wattage pneumatic switch and a humanoid-scale soft robotic gripper. The combination of 3D printing and self-healing elastomeric materials allows for facile production of support-free parts with extreme complexity, resulting in a paradigm shift for the construction of modular soft robotics.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Jun
Functionalization of hyaluronic acid for development of self-healing hydrogels for biomedical applications: A review.,"Materials that are capable of undergoing self-repair following any physical damage or rupture due to external stimuli are identified as self-healing materials. Such materials are engineered by crosslinking the polymer backbone chains typically through reversible linkages. These reversible linkages include imines, metal-ligand coordination, polyelectrolyte interaction, disulfide, etc. These bonds are reversibly responsive to changes in various stimuli. Newer self-healing materials are now being developed in the field of biomedicine. Chitosan, cellulose, starch etc. are a few examples of polysaccharides that are generally used to synthesize such materials. Hyaluronic acid has been a very recent addition to the list of polysaccharides that are being investigated for construction of self-healing materials. It is non-toxic, non-immunogenic, has good gelation property and good injectability. Hyaluronic acid based self-healing materials are particularly employed for targeted drug delivery, protein and cell delivery, electronics, biosensors and many such biomedical applications.

Amine-modified magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle as a promising carrier for application in bio self-healing concrete.,"Self-healing mechanisms are a promising solution to address the concrete cracking issue. Among the investigated self-healing strategies, the biotechnological approach is distinguished itself by inducing the most compatible material with concrete composition. In this method, the potent bacteria and nutrients are incorporated into the concrete matrix. Once cracking occurs, the bacteria will be activated, and the induced CaCO<sub>3</sub> crystals will seal the concrete cracks. However, the effectiveness of a bio self-healing concrete strictly depends on the viability of bacteria. Therefore, it is required to protect the bacteria from the resulted shear forces caused by mixing and drying shrinkage of concrete. Due to the positive effects on mechanical properties and the high compatibility of metallic nanoparticles with concrete composition, for the first time, we propose 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane-coated iron oxide nanoparticles (APTES-coated IONs) as a biocompatible carrier for Bacillus species. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of APTES-coated IONs on the bacterial viability and CaCO<sub>3</sub> yield for future application in the concrete structures. The APTES-coated IONs were successfully synthesized and characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR). The results show that the presence of 100 μg/mL APTES-coated IONs could increase the bacterial viability. It was also found that the CaCO<sub>3</sub>-specific yield was significantly affected in the presence of APTES-coated IONs. The highest CaCO<sub>3</sub>-specific yield was achieved when the cells were decorated with 50 μg/mL of APTES-coated IONs. This study provides new insights for the application of APTES-coated IONs in designing bio self-healing strategies.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2018,Jan

"Oxide Cathodes: Functions, Instabilities, Self Healing, and Degradation Mitigations.","Recent progress in high-energy-density oxide cathodes for lithium-ion batteries has pushed the limits of lithium usage and accessible redox couples. It often invokes hybrid anion- and cation-redox (HACR), with exotic valence states such as oxidized oxygen ions under high voltages. Electrochemical cycling under such extreme conditions over an extended period can trigger various forms of chemical, electrochemical, mechanical, and microstructural degradations, which shorten the battery life and cause safety issues. Mitigation strategies require an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Here we offer a systematic overview of the functions, instabilities, and peculiar materials behaviors of the oxide cathodes. We note unusual anion and cation mobilities caused by high-voltage charging and exotic valences. It explains the extensive lattice reconstructions at room temperature in both good (plasticity and self-healing) and bad (phase change, corrosion, and damage) senses, with intriguing electrochemomechanical coupling. The insights are critical to the understanding of the unusual self-healing phenomena in ceramics (e.g., grain boundary sliding and lattice microcrack healing) and to novel cathode designs and degradation mitigations (e.g., suppressing stress-corrosion cracking and constructing reactively wetted cathode coating). Such mixed ionic-electronic conducting, electrochemically active oxides can be thought of as almost ""metalized"" if at voltages far from the open-circuit voltage, thus differing significantly from the highly insulating ionic materials in electronic transport and mechanical behaviors. These characteristics should be better understood and exploited for high-performance energy storage, electrocatalysis, and other emerging applications.",Chemical reviews,eng,2023,Jan
Preparation and Biomedical Applications of Cucurbit[n]uril-Based Supramolecular Hydrogels.,"The cucurbit[n]uril supramolecular hydrogels are driven by weak intermolecular interactions, of which exhibit good stimuli responsiveness and excellent self-healing properties. According to the composition of the gelling factor, supramolecular hydrogels comprise Q[n]-cross-linked small molecules and Q[n]-cross-linked polymers.

"Infliximab-based self-healing hydrogel composite scaffold enhances stem cell survival, engraftment, and function in rheumatoid arthritis treatment.","Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a severe inflammatory autoimmune disease, but its treatment has been very difficult. Recently, stem cell-based therapies have opened up possibilities for the treatment of RA. However, the hostile RA pathological conditions impede the survival and differentiation of transplanted cells, and it remains challenging to fabricate a suitable biomaterial for the improvement of stem cells survival, engraftment, and function. Here we construct an optimal scaffold for RA management through the integration of 3D printed porous metal scaffolds (3DPMS) and infliximab-based hydrogels. The presence of rigid 3DPMS is appropriate for repairing large-scale bone defects caused by RA, while the designed infliximab-based hydrogels are introduced because of their self-healable, anti-inflammatory, biocompatible, and biodegradable properties. We demonstrate that the bioengineered composite scaffolds support adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (ADSCs) proliferation, differentiation, and extracellular matrix production in vitro. The composite scaffolds, along with ADSCs, are then implanted into the critical-sized bone defect in the RA rabbit model. In vivo results prove that the bioengineered composite scaffolds are able to down-regulate inflammatory cytokines, rebuild damaged cartilage, as well as improve subchondral bone repair.

A New Self-Healing Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Polyurethane Coating and Its Application for Self-Powered Cathodic Protection.,"With the increasing demand for carbon neutrality, the development of renewable and recycle green energy has attracted wide attention from researchers. A novel self-healing triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) was constructed by applying a linear silicone-modified polyurethane (PU) coating as a triboelectric layer, which was obtained by reacting hydroxypropyl silicone oil and hexamethylene diisocyanate under the catalysis of Sn. The linear self-healing coating as the friction electrode could effectively alleviate the damages of TENG devices during long-term energy harvesting. When the triboelectric layer of the TENG device shows abrasion, the broken silicone-modified polyurethane polymer chains would gradually be cross-linked again through hydrogen bonding to achieve a self-healing effect. The entire self-healing process of the friction coating could be completed in 30 min at room temperature. The PU-based self-healing TENG exhibits an evident and stable output performance with a short-circuit current of 31.9 μA and output voltage of 517.5 V after multiple cutting-healing cycles, which could light 480 commercial LEDs. Besides, a self-powered cathodic protection system supplied by the self-healing TENG was constructed, which could transfer negative triboelectric charges to the protected metal surface to achieve an anti-corrosion effect by harvesting mechanical energy. Due to the self-healing characteristics of the TENG device as the power supply part, this intelligent system possesses great application potential in the long-term corrosion protection of multiple metal application industries, such as the marine industry.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Mar
Self-Healing Properties of Bioinspired Amorphous CaCO<sub>3</sub>/Polyphosphate-Supplemented Cement.,"There is a strong interest in cement additives that are able to prevent or mitigate the adverse effects of cracks in concrete that cause corrosion of the reinforcement. Inorganic polyphosphate (polyP), a natural polymer that is synthesized by bacteria, even those on cement/concrete, can increase the resistance of concrete to progressive damage from micro-cracking. Here we use a novel bioinspired strategy based on polyP-stabilized amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) to give this material self-healing properties. Portland cement was supplemented with ACC nanoparticles which were stabilized with 10% (<i>w/w</i>) Na-polyP. Embedding these particles in the hydrated cement resulted in the formation of calcite crystals after a hardening time of 10 days, which were not seen in controls, indicating that the particles dissolve and then transform into calcite. While there was no significant repair in the controls without ACC, almost complete closure of the cracks was observed after a 10 days healing period in the ACC-supplemented samples. Nanoindentation measurements on the self-healed crack surfaces showed a similar or slightly higher elasticity at a lower hardness compared to non-cracked surfaces. Our results demonstrate that bioinspired approaches, like the use of polyP-stabilized ACC shown here, can significantly improve the repair capacity of Portland cement.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,May
Investigation of Self-Healing Mortars with and without Bagasse Ash at Pre- and Post-Crack Times.,"Cracks in typical mortar constructions enhance water permeability and degrade ions into the structure, resulting in decreased mortar durability and strength. In this study, mortar samples are created that self-healed their cracks by precipitating calcium carbonate into them. <i>Bacillus subtilus</i> bacterium (10<sup>-7</sup>, 10<sup>-9</sup> cells/mL), calcium lactate, fine aggregate, OPC-cement, water, and bagasse ash were used to make self-healing mortar samples. Calcium lactates were prepared from discarded eggshells and lactic acid to reduce the cost of self-healing mortars, and 5% control burnt bagasse ash was also employed as an OPC-cement alternative. In the presence of moisture, the bacterial spores in mortars become active and begin to feed the nutrient (calcium lactate). The calcium carbonate precipitates and plugs the fracture. Our experimental results demonstrated that cracks in self-healing mortars containing bagasse ash were largely healed after 3 days of curing, but this did not occur in conventional mortar samples. Cracks up to 0.6 mm in self-healing mortars were filled with calcite using 10<sup>-7</sup> and 10<sup>-9</sup> cell/mL bacteria concentrations. Images from an optical microscope, X-ray Diffraction (XRD), and a scanning electron microscope (SEM) were used to confirm the production of calcite in fractures. Furthermore, throughout the pre- and post-crack-development stages, self-healing mortars have higher compressive strength than conventional mortars. The precipitated calcium carbonates were primed to compact the samples by filling the void spaces in hardened mortar samples. When fissures developed in hardened mortars, bacteria became active in the presence of moisture, causing calcite to precipitate and fill the cracks. The compressive strength and flexural strength of self-healing mortar samples are higher than conventional mortars before cracks develop in the samples. After the healing process of the broken mortar parts (due to cracking), self-healing mortars containing 5% bagasse ash withstand a certain load and have greater flexural strength (100 kPa) than conventional mortars (zero kPa) at 28 days of cure. Self-healing mortars absorb less water than typical mortar samples. Mortar samples containing 10<sup>-7</sup> bacteria cells/mL exhibit greater compressive strength, flexural strength, and self-healing ability. XRD and SEM were used to analyze mortar samples with healed fractures. XRD, FTIR, and SEM images were also used to validate the produced calcium lactate. Furthermore, the durability of mortars was evaluated using DTA-TGA analysis and water absorption tests.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Feb
Highly Robust and Self-Powered Electronic Skin Based on Tough Conductive Self-Healing Elastomer.,"Self-powered electronic skin (E-skin) can be endowed with high robustness by employing self-healing materials. However, most self-powered E-skin employs two heterogeneous materials with high modulus mismatch at the interface and poor fully self-healing ability, which reduces the robustness of the whole device. Here, a conductive polyurethane elastomer (PUE) with excellent mechanical toughness and self-healing ability is prepared. Based on the self-healing insulated/conductive PUE homogeneous structure and triboelectric-electrostatic induction effect, a highly robust and self-powered E-skin (HRSE-skin) is developed. The HRSE-skin possesses stable mechanosensation capability during the 50% stretching deformation due to a low modulus mismatch in the homogeneous structure. In addition, the stretchability and mechanosensation capability of the HRSE-skin can be restored after the fracture owing to the fully self-healing ability of the homogeneous structure. Therefore, the HRSE-skin has high robustness of the whole device including stable service behaviors and excellent restorability. The developed HRSE-skin demonstrates high robustness in the detection of the force and bending angle of the prosthetic joint. This work solves the low robustness of self-powered E-skin by the preparation of conductive self-healing PUE and the construction of the homogeneous structure, which is important for the practical applications of self-powered E-skin in prosthetic limbs and advanced robotics.",ACS nano,eng,2020,Jul

Self-Healing Supramolecular Self-Assembled Hydrogels Based on Poly(L-glutamic acid).,"Self-healing polymeric hydrogels have the capability to recover their structures and functionalities upon injury, which are extremely attractive in emerging biomedical applications. This research reports a new kind of self-healing polypeptide hydrogels based on self-assembly between cholesterol (Chol)-modified triblock poly(L-glutamic acid)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(L-glutamic acid) ((PLGA-b-PEG-b-PLGA)-g-Chol) and β-cyclodextrin (β-CD)-modified poly(L-glutamic acid) (PLGA-g-β-CD).

To develop a more suitable bacteria carrier as well as improve the anti-crack capability of self-healing concrete, in this study we evaluate the feasibility of using rubber particles as a novel bacteria carrier in self-healing concrete. Two types of self-healing concrete are prepared with rubber particles of different sizes to quantify the crack-healing effect. In addition, the fluidity and mechanical properties of the self-healing rubber concrete are compared with those of plain concrete and normal rubber concrete. The experimental results show that the self-healing rubber concrete with a particle size of 1~3 mm has a better healing capacity than the self-healing rubber concrete with a particle size of 0.2~0.4 mm, and the width value of the completely healed crack is 0.86 mm. The self-healing rubber concrete has a higher slump than the plain concrete and normal rubber concrete. According to the strength tests, the compressive strengths of the self-healing rubber concrete are low early on but they exceed those of the corresponding normal rubber concrete at 28 days. Moreover, the self-healing rubber concrete has higher splitting tensile strengths than the plain concrete and a better anti-crack capability. The results of a comparison to the other two representative bacterial carriers indicate that rubber particles have potential to be a widely used bacteria carrier for practical engineering applications in self-healing concrete.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2019,Jul
Robust Self-Healing Graphene Oxide-Based Superhydrophobic Coatings for Efficient Corrosion Protection of Magnesium Alloys.,"A self-healing coating possesses a broad application prospect in the metal corrosion protection area due to its pleasurable performance. By far, despite a great deal of research studies that have been reported in this field, it is still a challenge to construct an intrinsic self-healing surface that can repair a damaged structure and restore superhydrophobicity simultaneously. Herein, a self-healing superhydrophobic coating was fabricated by combining polydopamine (PDA)-functionalized Cu<sup>2+</sup>-doped graphene oxide (GO), octadecylamine (ODA), and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), which can recover the superhydrophobicity and microstructure of the coating after chemical/physical damage. The as-prepared self-healing coating displayed excellent liquid repellency with a water contact angle of 158.2 ± 2° and a sliding angle of 4 ± 1°, which endowed the Mg alloy with excellent anticorrosion performance. Once the coating is scratched, the local damaged structure will be automatically repaired through the chelation of catechol and Cu<sup>2+</sup>. Also, the superhydrophobicity of the coating can be rapidly restored under 1-sun irradiation even after being etched by O<sub>2</sub> plasma. Furthermore, the as-fabricated self-healing coating still exhibited excellent corrosion protection against a magnesium alloy after immersion in 3.5 wt % NaCl solution for 30 days, which was attributed to the efficient repair of defects in GO by PDA through π-π interactions and the inherent chemical inertia of PDMS. Moreover, the as-fabricated self-healing coating also exhibited favorable mechanical stability, chemical durability, and weather resistance. This study paves a fresh insight into the design of robust self-healing coatings with huge application potential.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Jul
Effect of Bacillus subtilis on mechanical and self-healing properties in mortar with different crack widths and curing conditions.,"This research aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) in self-healing cracks in concrete and enhancing concrete strength through microbial induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). The study evaluated the ability of the mortar to cover cracks within 28 days, taking into account the width of the crack, and observed the recovery of strength after self-healing. The use of microencapsulated endospores of B. subtilis was also examined for its impact on the strength of concrete. The compressive, splitting tensile, and flexural strengths of normal mortar were compared to those of biological mortar, and it was found that biological mortar had a higher strength capacity. Microstructure analysis using SEM and EDS showed that bacterial growth increased calcium production, contributing to the improved mechanical properties of the bio-mortar.",Scientific reports,eng,2023,May
Self-Healing of Prussian Blue Analogues with Electrochemically Driven Morphological Rejuvenation.,"Maintaining the morphology of electrode materials with high invertibility contributes to the prolonged cyclic stability of battery systems. However, the majority of electrode materials tend to degrade during the charge-discharge process owing to the inevitable increase in entropy. Herein, a self-healing strategy is designed to promote morphology rejuvenation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes by cobalt doping. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrate that a trace amount of cobalt can decelerate the crystallization process and restore the cracked areas to ensure perfect cubic structures of PBA cathodes. The electric field controls the kinetic dynamics, rather than the conventional thermodynamics, to realize the ""electrochemically driven dissolution-recrystallization process"" for the periodic self-healing phenomenon. The properties of electron transportation and ion diffusion in bulk PBA are also improved by the doping strategy, thus boosting the cyclability with 4000 cycles in a diluent electrolyte. This discovery provides a new paradigm for the construction of self-healing electrodes for cathodes.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2022,Nov
The artificial leaf.,"To convert the energy of sunlight into chemical energy, the leaf splits water via the photosynthetic process to produce molecular oxygen and hydrogen, which is in a form of separated protons and electrons. The primary steps of natural photosynthesis involve the absorption of sunlight and its conversion into spatially separated electron-hole pairs. The holes of this wireless current are captured by the oxygen evolving complex (OEC) of photosystem II (PSII) to oxidize water to oxygen. The electrons and protons produced as a byproduct of the OEC reaction are captured by ferrodoxin of photosystem I. With the aid of ferrodoxin-NADP(+) reductase, they are used to produce hydrogen in the form of NADPH. For a synthetic material to realize the solar energy conversion function of the leaf, the light-absorbing material must capture a solar photon to generate a wireless current that is harnessed by catalysts, which drive the four electron/hole fuel-forming water-splitting reaction under benign conditions and under 1 sun (100 mW/cm(2)) illumination. This Account describes the construction of an artificial leaf comprising earth-abundant elements by interfacing a triple junction, amorphous silicon photovoltaic with hydrogen- and oxygen-evolving catalysts made from a ternary alloy (NiMoZn) and a cobalt-phosphate cluster (Co-OEC), respectively. The latter captures the structural and functional attributes of the PSII-OEC. Similar to the PSII-OEC, the Co-OEC self-assembles upon oxidation of an earth-abundant metal ion from 2+ to 3+, may operate in natural water at room temperature, and is self-healing. The Co-OEC also activates H(2)O by a proton-coupled electron transfer mechanism in which the Co-OEC is increased by four hole equivalents akin to the S-state pumping of the Kok cycle of PSII. X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies have established that the Co-OEC is a structural relative of Mn(3)CaO(4)-Mn cubane of the PSII-OEC, where Co replaces Mn and the cubane is extended in a corner-sharing, head-to-tail dimer. The ability to perform the oxygen-evolving reaction in water at neutral or near-neutral conditions has several consequences for the construction of the artificial leaf. The NiMoZn alloy may be used in place of Pt to generate hydrogen. To stabilize silicon in water, its surface is coated with a conducting metal oxide onto which the Co-OEC may be deposited. The net result is that immersing a triple-junction Si wafer coated with NiMoZn and Co-OEC in water and holding it up to sunlight can effect direct solar energy conversion via water splitting. By constructing a simple, stand-alone device composed of earth-abundant materials, the artificial leaf provides a means for an inexpensive and highly distributed solar-to-fuels system that employs low-cost systems engineering and manufacturing. Through this type of system, solar energy can become a viable energy supply to those in the non-legacy world.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2012,May
Dynamic covalent polymers enabled by reversible isocyanate chemistry.,"The design of responsive materials by introducing dynamic covalent bonds (DCBs), which can undergo reversible association and dissociation under certain conditions, is an appealing research field in recent years. Reversible isocyanate chemistry representatively consists of urethane, thiourethane, and urea bonds, all of which can reverse into their own starting chemicals (isocyanates and active hydrogen compounds) upon heating. In this article, we overview the mechanisms and experimental elements affecting the dynamic features of isocyanate-based bonds (IBs). With the knowledge of reversible isocyanate chemistry, the construction strategies of different dynamic covalent polymers including polyurethanes, polyureas, and polythiourethanes are discussed, in particular for dynamic polymer networks. The major applications of dynamic isocyanate-based polymers in recycling and self-healing materials, shape morphing polymers, 3D printing, and composites are outlined. The emergence of reversible isocyanate chemistry offers a highly effective platform to engineer thermally adaptable materials.","Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",eng,2022,Nov
Self-healing boronic acid-based hydrogels for 3D co-cultures.,"Synthetic hydrogels have been widely adopted as well-defined matrices for three-dimensional (3D) cell culture, with increasing interest in systems that enable the co-culture of multiple cell types for probing both cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions in studies of tissue regeneration and disease. We hypothesized that the unique dynamic covalent chemistry of self-healing hydrogels could be harnessed for not only the encapsulation and culture of human cells but also the subsequent construction of layered hydrogels for 3D co-cultures. To test this, we formed hydrogels using boronic acid-functionalized polymers and demonstrated their self-healing in the presence of physiologically-relevant cell culture media. Two model human cell lines, MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and CCL151 pulmonary fibroblasts, were encapsulated within these dynamic materials, and good viability was observed over time. Finally, self-healing of cut hydrogel 'blocks' laden with these different cell types was used to create layered hydrogels for the generation of a dynamic co-culture system. This work demonstrates the utility of self-healing materials for multi-dimensional cultures and establishes approaches broadly useful for a variety of biological applications.",ACS macro letters,eng,2018,Sep
Stretchable and self-healable hydrogel artificial skin.,"Hydrogels have emerged as promising materials for the construction of skin-like mechanical sensors. The common design of hydrogel-based artificial skin requires a dielectric sandwiched between two hydrogel layers for capacitive sensing. However, such a planar configuration limits the sensitivity, stretchability and self-healing properties. Here, we report the design of single-layer composite hydrogels with bulk capacitive junctions as mechanical sensors. We engineer dielectric peptide-coated graphene (PCG) to serve as homogenously dispersed electric double layers in hydrogels. Any mechanical motions that alter the microscopic distributions of PCG in the hydrogels can significantly change the overall capacitance. We use peptide self-assembly to render strong yet dynamic interfacial interactions between the hydrogel network and graphene. The resulting hydrogels can be stretched up to 77 times their original length and self-heal in a few minutes. The devices can effectively sense strain and pressure in both air and aqueous environments, providing tremendous opportunities for next-generation iontronics.",National science review,eng,2022,Jul
Self-Healing Textile: Enzyme Encapsulated Layer-by-Layer Structural Proteins.,"Self-healing materials, which enable an autonomous repair response to damage, are highly desirable for the long-term reliability of woven or nonwoven textiles. Polyelectrolyte layer-by-layer (LbL) films are of considerable interest as self-healing coatings due to the mobility of the components comprising the film. In this work mechanically stable self-healing films were fabricated through construction of a polyelectrolyte LbL film containing squid ring teeth (SRT) proteins. SRTs are structural proteins with unique self-healing properties and high elastic modulus in both dry and wet conditions (>2 GPa) due to their semicrystalline architecture. We demonstrate LbL construction of multilayers containing native and recombinant SRT proteins capable of self-healing defects. Additionally, we show these films are capable of utilizing functional biomolecules by incorporating an enzyme into the SRT multilayer. Urease was chosen as a model enzyme of interest to test its activity via fluorescence assay. Successful construction of the SRT films demonstrates the use of mechanically stable self-healing coatings, which can incorporate biomolecules for more complex protective functionalities for advanced functional fabrics.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2016,Aug
Performance-Based Evaluation of Healing Efficiency on Mechanical Properties of Self-Healing Cementitious Materials Incorporated with PMMA/Epoxy Microcapsule.,"In this study, based upon the investigation of its effect on workability and the mechanical property of cementitious materials, the Box-Behnken design was adopted to establish models describing self-healing performance on mechanical properties of cementitious materials with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA)/epoxy microcapsule in terms of healing rate of peak strength (Y1), the recovery rate of peak strength (Y2), the healing rate of Young's modulus (Y3), the recovery rate of Young's modulus (Y4), the healing rate of peak strain (Y5), and recovery rate of peak strain (Y6). This was performed under the influence of the four factors, including microcapsule size (X1), microcapsule content (X2), pre-loading (X3), and curing age (X4). The results showed the four factors significantly affect the healing rate and recovery rate of the peak strength, Young's modulus, and peak strain, except the healing rate on peak strain. Moreover, the interaction between the factors showed some influence as well. The numerically optimised values of X1, X2, X3, and X4 are 203 nm, 5.59%, 43.56%, and 21 days, respectively, and the self-healing cementitious materials with desirable mechanical characteristics (Y1 63.67%, Y2 145.22%, Y3 40.34%, Y4 132.22%, Y5 27.66%, and Y6 133.84%) with the highest desirability of 0.9050 were obtained. Moreover, the porosity of the specimen confirmed the healing performance of PMMA/epoxy microcapsules in cementitious materials.",Polymers,eng,2022,Jun
Performance of Self-Healing Cementitious Composites Using Aligned Tubular Healing Fiber.,"From the perspective of improving the self-healing method in construction, a tubular healing fiber was adopted as a container to improve the encapsulation capacity, which was available using a micro-capsule as a container. Knowing the direction of the stresses to which structure members are subjected, this research investigated the influence of aligning tubular healing fibers parallel to intended stress into a cementitious composite to increase the self-healing capability. For that, a healing agent was encapsulated into a tubular healing fiber made with polyvinylidene of fluoride resin (PVDF). Then, the healing fiber was combined with steel fibers to align both fibers together parallel to the direction of an intended splitting tensile stress when subjected to a magnetic field in a cylindrical cementitious composite. The alignment method and the key point through which the alignment of the healing fibers could efficiently improve autonomic self-healing were investigated. Since the magnetic field is known to be able to drag steel to an expected direction, steel fibers were combined with the healing fibers to form a hybrid fiber that aligned both fibers together. The required mixture workability was investigated to avoid the sinking of the healing fibers into the mixture. The healing efficiency, according to the orientation of the healing fibers in the composite matrix, was evaluated through a permeability test and a repetitive splitting tensile test. The aligned healing fibers performed better than the randomly distributed healing fibers. However, according to the healing efficiency with aligned healing fibers, it was deduced that the observed decreasing effect of the container's alignment on the specimen's mechanical properties was low enough to be neglected.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Oct
Self-assembly of chlorogenic acid into hydrogel for accelerating wound healing.,"Wound healing remains a considerable challenge due to its complex inflammatory microenvironment. Developing novel wound dressing materials with superior wound repair capabilities is highly required. However, conventional dressing hydrogels for wound healing are often limited by their complex cross-linking, high treatment costs, and drug-related side effects. In this study, we report a novel dressing hydrogel constructed only by the self-assembly of chlorogenic acid (CA). Molecular dynamic simulation studies revealed the formation of CA hydrogel was mainly through non-covalent interactions, such as π-π and hydrogen bond. Meanwhile, CA hydrogel exhibited superior self-healing, injectability, and biocompatibility properties, making it a promising candidate for wound treatment. As expected, in vitro experiments demonstrated that CA hydrogel possessed remarkable anti-inflammatory activity, and its ability to promote the generation of microvessels in HUVEC cells, as well as the promotion of microvessel formation in HUVEC cells and proliferation of HaCAT cells. Subsequent in vivo investigation further demonstrated that CA hydrogel accelerated wound healing in rats through regulating macrophage polarization. Mechanistically, the CA hydrogel treatment enhanced the closure rate, collagen deposition, and re-epithelialization while simultaneously suppressing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and increasing the production of CD31 and VEGF during the wound healing process. Our findings indicate that this multifunctional CA hydrogel is a promising candidate for wound healing, particularly in cases of impaired angiogenesis and inflammatory responses.","Colloids and surfaces.

Review on Carbonation Study of Reinforcement Concrete Incorporating with Bacteria as Self-Healing Approach.,"This study carried out a comprehensive review to determine the carbonation process that causes the most deterioration and destruction of concrete. The carbonation mechanism involved using carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) to penetrate the concrete pore system into the atmosphere and reduce the alkalinity by decreasing the pH level around the reinforcement and initiation of the corrosion process. The use of bacteria in the concrete was to increase the pH of the concrete by producing urease enzyme. This technique may help to maintain concrete alkalinity in high levels, even when the carbonation process occurs, because the CO<sub>2</sub> accelerates to the concrete and then converts directly to calcium carbonate, CaCO<sub>3</sub>. Consequently, the self-healing of the cracks and the pores occurred as a result of the carbonation process and bacteria enzyme reaction. As a result of these reactions, the concrete steel is protected, and the concrete properties and durability may improve. However, there are several factors that control carbonation which have been grouped into internal and external factors. Many studies on carbonation have been carried out to explore the effect of bacteria to improve durability and concrete strength. However, an in-depth literature review revealed that the use of bacteria as a self-healing mechanism can still be improved upon. This review aimed to highlight and discuss the possibility of applying bacteria in concrete to improve reinforcement concrete.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Aug
Osteogenic and pH stimuli-responsive self-healing coating on biomedical Mg-1Ca alloy.,"Various coatings have been used to slow down the corrosion rate of biomedical magnesium alloys. However, these coatings usually act only as passive barriers. It is much more desirable to endow such coatings with active, biocorrosion-responsive self-repairing capacity. In the present work, a self-healing coating system (denoted as ""silk-PA"") was constructed in the form of a sandwich architecture of fluoride precoating (bottom), silk-phytic acid (PA) coating (middle), and silk fibroin coating (top). Here, PA was loaded in the middle coating as a corrosion inhibitor by harnessing its strong chelating ability toward dissolving Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions. The self-healing property was evaluated by scratch and SVET tests, and the corrosion resistance was evaluated by in vitro immersion and electrochemical measurements. The results showed that the silk-PA manifested intriguing self-healing capacity with pH responsiveness, hence profiting the corrosion resistance of the Mg-1Ca alloy. The biocompatibility and osteogenic activity of the coating system were further evaluated using MC3T3-E1 cells, and it demonstrated favorable responses in multiple cellular behaviors, i.e., adherence, spreading, proliferation, and differentiation. These findings open new opportunities in the study of self-healing coatings for protection against corrosion in biomedical Mg alloys. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In the present study, a self-healing coating system with pH stimuli-responsiveness and osteogenic activity was fabricated on Mg-1Ca alloy by integrating a silk fibroin barrier coating, a silk fibrin/phytic acid composite coating, and a fluoride precoating. This coating system demonstrated interesting self-healing ability as compared to traditional surface modification layers. Furthermore, the self-healing ability enhanced the corrosion resistance of biomedical magnesium alloys, while effective compositions of the coating system endowed the substrate with osteogenic activity.

Self-healing liquid metal hydrogel for human-computer interaction and infrared camouflage.,"Due to their mechanical flexibility, conductive hydrogels have been widely investigated in the fields of flexible electronics and soft robots, but their non-negligible disadvantages, such as poor toughness and limited self-healing, severally restrict their practical application. Herein, gallium indium alloy (EGaIn) is utilized to initiate the polymerization and simultaneously serve as flexible fillers to construct a super-stretchable and self-healing liquid metal/polyvinyl alcohol/<i>p</i>(acrylamide-<i>co</i>-octadecyl methacrylate) (liquid metal/PVA/P(AAm-<i>co</i>-SMA)) double network hydrogel (LM hydrogel). The synergistic effect of the rigid PVA microcrystal network and the ductile P(AAm-<i>co</i>-SMA) hydrophobic network, together with the ionic coordination and hydrogen bonds between polymer networks (multiple physical cross-links), endow the LM hydrogel with excellent super-stretchability (2000%), toughness (3.00 MJ m<sup>-3</sup>), notch resistance, and self-healing property (healing efficiency > 99% at 25 °C after 24 h). The LM hydrogel exhibits sensitive strain sensing behavior, allowing human-computer interaction to achieve motion recognition and health monitoring. Significantly, owing to the excellent photothermal effect and low infrared emissivity of EGaIn, the LM hydrogel reveals great potential in infrared camouflage.

"Hydrogen-Bonded Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Polymers: Smart Materials with Stimuli-Responsive, Self-Healing, and Recyclable Properties.","Hydrogen-bonded liquid crystalline polymers have emerged as promising ""smart"" supramolecular functional materials with stimuli-responsive, self-healing, and recyclable properties.

[Research progress in spore-based in-situ restoration technology of concrete with microorganisms].,"Concrete is the most widely used modern building material. It is easy to crack under the action of stress, which makes the concrete structure permeable, affecting the durability and integrity of the structure, and thus shortening its service life.

Improving Self-Healing and Shrinkage Reduction of Cementitious Materials Using Water-Absorbing Polymer Microcapsules.,"Self-healing cementitious materials are a promising means for ensuring sustainable concrete infrastructure and promoting long-term service lives. To obtain microcapsules that are versatile in varying environments, in this study, absorbing microcapsules with calcium alginate as the shell and epoxy resin as the core were prepared. The absorbing microcapsules exhibit self-healing and can reduce the shrinkage of cementitious materials. Volume changes of the microcapsules in the hardened paste with increasing hydration age were observed using three-dimensional X-ray computed tomography. In the hardened cement paste with a water-cement ratio of 0.29, the absorption of the microcapsules lasted for several days, and the release of water lasted for 28 days. The absorption of microcapsules affected the fluidity of cement paste, and it was significantly weakened and delayed due to the lower absorption rate. The addition of absorbing microcapsules significantly reduced the autogenous and drying shrinkage of mortars. For microcapsules with a core content of 55% added at 3.5% of cement weight, autogenous shrinkage was almost eliminated. Most importantly, the addition of absorbing microcapsules could achieve a certain degree of recovery of compressive strength as well as satisfactory recovery of impermeability in dry and wet environments.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Jan
Self-Healing and Highly Stretchable Hydrogel for Interfacial Compatible Flexible Paper-Based Micro-Supercapacitor.,"Most reported wearable electronic devices lack self-healing chemistry and flexible function to maintain stable energy output while irreversible damages and complex deformations. In this work, we report a dual-dynamic network electrolyte synthesized by micellar elastomers introduced into strong hydrogel matrix. The gel electrolyte is fabricated by physically cross-linking the borax-polyvinyl alcohol (B-PVA) network as tough matrix and poly (ethylene oxide) (PEO)-poly (propylene oxide) (PPO)-poly (ethylene oxide) (Pluronic) to frame elastic network, followed by immersion in potassium chloride solution. Under the action of dynamic borate ester bond and multi-network hydrogen bond, the as-prepared electrolyte exhibits high stretchability (1535%) and good self-healing efficiency. Based on the electrolyte, we assemble the interfacial compatible micro-supercapacitor (MSC) by multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) interdigital electrode printed on cellulosic paper by direct ink writing (DIW) technique. Thanks to the large specific area and compressive deformation resistance of cellulosic paper, the MSC with tightly interfacial contact achieves high volumetric capacitance of 801.9 mF cm<sup>-3</sup> at the current density of 20 μA cm<sup>-2</sup>. In the absence of stimulation of the external environment, the self-healing MSC demonstrates an ideal capacity retention (90.43%) after five physical damaged/healing cycles.

Structural Strategies for Supramolecular Hydrogels and Their Applications.,"Supramolecular structures are of great interest due to their applicability in various scientific and industrial fields. The sensible definition of supramolecular molecules is being set by investigators who, because of the different sensitivities of their methods and observational timescales, may have different views on as to what constitutes these supramolecular structures.

Self-Healing Characteristics of Damaged Rock Salt under Different Healing Conditions.,"Salt deposits are commonly regarded as ideal hosts for geologic energy reservoirs. Underground cavern construction-induced damage in salt is reduced by self-healing. Thus, studying the influencing factors on such healing processes is important. This research uses ultrasonic technology to monitor the longitudinal wave velocity variations of stress-damaged rock salts during self-recovery experiments under different recovery conditions. The influences of stress-induced initial damage, temperature, humidity, and oil on the self-recovery of damaged rock salts are analyzed. The wave velocity values of the damaged rock salts increase rapidly during the first 200 h of recovery, and the values gradually increase toward stabilization after 600 h. The recovery of damaged rock salts is subjected to higher initial damage stress. Water is important in damage recovery. The increase in temperature improves damage recovery when water is abundant, but hinders recovery when water evaporates. The presence of residual hydraulic oil blocks the inter-granular role of water and restrains the recovery under triaxial compression. The results indicate that rock salt damage recovery is related to the damage degree, pore pressure, temperature, humidity, and presence of oil due to the sealing integrity of the jacket material.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2013,Aug
Bio-reinforced self-healing concrete using magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles.,"Immobilization has been reported as an efficient technique to address the bacterial vulnerability for application in bio self-healing concrete. In this study, for the first time, magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) are being practically employed as the protective vehicle for bacteria to evaluate the self-healing performance in concrete environment. Magnetic IONs were successfully synthesized and characterized using different techniques. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) images show the efficient adsorption of nanoparticles to the Bacillus cells. Microscopic observation illustrates that the incorporation of the immobilized bacteria in the concrete matrix resulted in a significant crack healing behavior, while the control specimen had no healing characteristics. Analysis of bio-precipitates revealed that the induced minerals in the cracks were calcium carbonate. The effect of magnetic immobilized cells on the concrete water absorption showed that the concrete specimens supplemented with decorated bacteria with IONs had a higher resistance to water penetration. The initial and secondary water absorption rates in bio-concrete specimens were 26% and 22% lower than the control specimens. Due to the compatible behavior of IONs with the concrete compositions, the results of this study proved the potential application of IONs for developing a new generation of bio self-healing concrete.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2018,Mar

Enzyme-Regulated Fast Self-Healing of a Pillararene-Based Hydrogel.,"Self-healing, one of the exciting properties of materials, is frequently used to repair the damage of biological and artificial systems. Here we have used enzymatic catalysis approaches to develop a fast self-healing hydrogel, which has been constructed by dynamic aldimine cross-linking of pillar[5]arene-derivant and dialdehyde-functionalized PEG followed by encapsulation of glucose oxidase (GOx) and catalase (CAT). In specific, the two hydroxyl groups at terminal of PEG<sub>4000</sub> are functionalized with benzaldehydes that can interact with amino-containing pillar[5]arene-derivant through dynamic aldimine cross-links, resulting in reversible dynamic hydrogels. Modulus analysis indicated that storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G″) of the hydrogel increased obviously as the concentration of dialdehyde-functionalized PEG<sub>4000</sub> (DF-PEG<sub>4000</sub>) increased or the pH values decreased. Once glucose oxidase (GOx) and catalase (CAT) are located, the hydrogel could be fast repaired, with self-healing efficiency up to 100%. Notably tensile test showed that the repair process of pillararene-based hydrogel can finish in several minutes upon enzyme catalysis, while it needed more than 24 h to achieve this recovery without enzymes. This enzyme-regulated self-healing hydrogel would hold promise for delivering drugs and for soft tissue regeneration in the future.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2017,Jun
Building a Poly(amino acid)/Chitosan-Based Self-Healing Hydrogel via Host-Guest Interaction for Cartilage Regeneration.,"Cartilage injury is a very common joint disease, and cartilage repair is a great challenge in clinical treatment due to the specific structure of cartilage tissue and its microenvironment <i>in vivo</i>. The injectable self-healing hydrogel is a very promising candidate as a cartilage repair material because of its special network structure, high water retention and self-healing properties. In this work, a self-healing hydrogel cross-linked by host-guest interaction between cyclodextrin and cholic acid was developed. The host material was composed of β-cyclodextrin and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-modified poly(l-glutamic acid) (P(LGA-<i>co</i>-GM-<i>co</i>-GC)), while the guest material was chitosan modified by cholic acid, glycidyl methacrylate, and (2,3-epoxypropyl)trimethylammonium chloride (EPTAC) (QCSG-CA). The host-guest interaction self-healing hydrogels, named as HG hydrogels (HG gel), exhibited excellent injectability and self-healable property, and the self-healing efficiency was greater than 90%. Furthermore, in order to enhance the mechanical properties and slow down the degradation of the HG gel <i>in vivo</i>, the second network was constructed by photo-cross-linking <i>in situ</i>. Biocompatibility tests showed that the enhanced multi-interaction hydrogel (MI gel) was extremely suitable for cartilage tissue engineering both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>.

Constructing ECM-like Structure on the Plasma Membrane via Peptide Assembly to Regulate the Cellular Response.,"This feature article introduces the design of self-assembling peptides that serve as the basic building blocks for the construction of extracellular matrix (ECM)-like structure in the vicinity of the plasma membrane. By covalently conjugating a bioactive motif, such as membrane protein binding ligand or enzymatic responsive building block, with a self-assembling motif, especially the aromatic peptide, a self-assembling peptide that retains bioactivity is obtained. Instructed by the target membrane protein or enzyme, the bioactive peptides self-assemble into ECM-like structure exerting various stimuli to regulate the cellular response via intracellular signaling, especially mechanotransduction. By briefly summarizing the properties and applications (e.g., wound healing, controlling cell motility and cell fate) of these peptides, we intend to illustrate the basic requirements and promises of the peptide assembly as a true bottom-up approach in the construction of artificial ECM.",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,eng,2022,Jul
A Bioinspired Self-Healing Conductive Hydrogel Promoting Peripheral Nerve Regeneration.,"The development of self-healing conductive hydrogels is critical in electroactive nerve tissue engineering. Typical conductive materials such as polypyrrole (PPy) are commonly used to fabricate artificial nerve conduits. Moreover, the field of tissue engineering has advanced toward the use of products such as hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels. Although HA-modified PPy films are prepared for various biological applications, the cell-matrix interaction mechanisms remain poorly understood; furthermore, there are no reports on HA-modified PPy-injectable self-healing hydrogels for peripheral nerve repair. Therefore, in this study, a self-healing electroconductive hydrogel (HASPy) from HA, cystamine (Cys), and pyrrole-1-propionic acid (Py-COOH), with injectability, biodegradability, biocompatibility, and nerve-regenerative capacity is constructed. The hydrogel directly targets interleukin 17 receptor A (IL-17RA) and promotes the expression of genes and proteins relevant to Schwann cell myelination mainly by activating the interleukin 17 (IL-17) signaling pathway. The hydrogel is injected directly into the rat sciatic nerve-crush injury sites to investigate its capacity for nerve regeneration in vivo and is found to promote functional recovery and remyelination. This study may help in understanding the mechanism of cell-matrix interactions and provide new insights into the potential use of HASPy hydrogel as an advanced scaffold for neural regeneration.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",eng,2023,Aug
"Self-Healing, Solvent-Free, Anti-Corrosion Coating Based on Skin-like Polyurethane/Carbon Nanotubes Composites with Real-Time Damage Monitoring.","Self-healing anti-corrosion materials are widely regarded as a promising long-term corrosion protection strategy, and this is even more significant if the damage can be monitored in real-time and consequently repaired. Inspired by the hierarchical structure of human skin, self-healing, solvent-free polyurethane/carbon nanotubes composites (SFPUHE-HTF-CNTs) with a skin-like bilayer structure were constructed. The SFPUHE-HTF-CNTs were composed of two layers, namely, a hydrophobic solvent-free polyurethane (SFPUHE-HTF) containing disulfide bonds and fluorinated polysiloxane chain segments consisting of a self-healing layer and CNTs with good electrical conductivity consisting of a corrosion protection layer, which also allowed for the real-time monitoring of damage. The results of corrosion protection experiments indicated that the SFPUHE-HTF-CNTs had a low corrosion current density (8.94 × 10<sup>-9</sup> A·cm<sup>-2</sup>), a positive corrosion potential (-0.38 V), and a high impedance modulus (|Z| = 4.79 × 10<sup>5</sup> Ω·cm<sup>2</sup>). The impedance modulus could still reach 4.54 × 10<sup>4</sup> Ω·cm<sup>2</sup> after self-healing, showing excellent self-healing properties for anti-corrosion protection. Synchronously, the SFPUHE-HTF-CNTs exhibited a satisfactory damage sensing performance, enabling the real-time monitoring of fractures at different sizes. This work realized the effective combination of self-healing with corrosion protection and damage detection functions through a bionic design, and revealed the green, and low-cost preparation of advanced composites, which have the advantage of scale production.","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Dec
"Injectable, self-healing poly(amino acid)-hydrogel based on phenylboronate ester bond for osteochondral tissue engineering.","A new generation of osteochondral integrated scaffolds is needed for articular osteochondral regeneration, which can not only facilitate the accurate construction of osteochondral scaffolds in a minimally invasive manner but also firmly combine the subchondral bone layer and cartilage layer. Herein, an osteochondral integrated hydrogel scaffold was constructed by the poly(L-glutamic acid) (PLGA) based self-healing hydrogels with phenylboronate ester (PBE) as the dynamic cross-linking. The bone layer self-healing hydrogel (hydrogel O-S) was prepared by physically blending nanohydroxyapatite into the self-healing hydrogel PLGA-PBE-S, which was fabricated by 3-aminophenylboronic acid/glycidyl methacrylate-modified PLGA (PLGA-GMA-PBA) and 3-amino-1,2-propanediol/N-(2-aminoethyl) acrylamide-modified PLGA (PLGA-ADE-AP). The cartilage layer self-healing hydrogel (hydrogel C-S) was prepared by PLGA-GMA-APBA and glucosamine- modified PLGA-ADE-AP (PLGA-ADE-AP-G). Excellent injectability and self-healing profiles of hydrogel O-S and C-S were observed, the self-healing efficiencies were 97.02% ± 1.06% and 99.06% ± 0.57%, respectively. Based on the injectability and spontaneous healing on the interfaces of hydrogel O-S and C-S, the osteochondral hydrogel (hydrogel OC) was conveniently constructed in a minimally invasive manner. In addition,<i>in situ</i>photocrosslinking was used to enhance the mechanical strength and stability of the osteochondral hydrogel. The osteochondral hydrogels exhibited good biodegradability and biocompatibility. The osteogenic differentiation genes BMP-2, ALPL, BGLAP and COL I of adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) in the bone layer of the osteochondral hydrogel were significantly expressed, and the chondrogenic differentiation genes SOX9, aggrecan and COL II of ASCs in the cartilage layer of the osteochondral hydrogel were obviously upregulated after 14 d of induction. The osteochondral hydrogels could effectively promote repair of osteochondral defects after 3 months post-surgery.","Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)",eng,2023,Jul
A self-healing hydrogel based on crosslinked hyaluronic acid and chitosan to facilitate diabetic wound healing.,"Traditional wound dressings are not able to provide ideal environment for diabetic wounds surface thus hampered the regrowth of fresh tissues. In this study, we designed a novel in situ forming hydrogel and used it as wound dressing material. Carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) were selected to construct a pH-responsive and self-healing hydrogel system via Schiff base reaction. Taurine (Tau) with anti-inflammatory property was loaded in the hydrogel through the aforementioned reaction. Under the slightly acidic environment of the diabetic wound site, a responsive release of taurine molecules speeded up the transfer of the taurine into the wound. The physiochemical properties of the prepared CMCS-OHA-Tau hydrogel were characterized. The CMCS-OHA-Tau hydrogel showed good biocompatibility, enhancement of cell migration and inhibited production of inflammatory cytokines.Subsequently, the hydrogel was applied on the wounds of diabetic rats and its boosted efficacy for wound recovery was confirmed.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2022,Nov
Self-healing hybrid hydrogels with sustained bioactive components release for guided bone regeneration.,"Guided bone regeneration (GBR) is widely used in treating oral bone defects to exclude the influence of non-osteogenic tissue on the bone healing process. The traditional method of GBR with a titanium mesh to treat large-area bone defects is limited by the deficiency of increased trauma and costs to patients. Herein, a bi-layered scaffold for GBR composed of a fiber barrier layer and a self-healing hydrogel repair layer is successfully fabricated. The barrier layer is a fibrous membrane material with specific porosity constructed by electrospinning, while the functional layer is a self-healing hydrogel material formed by multiple dynamic covalent bonds. The system can provide an osteogenic microenvironment by preventing the infiltration of connective tissue to bone defects, maintain the stability of the osteogenic space through the self-healing property, and regulate the release of bioactive substances in the dynamic physical condition, which is beneficial to osteoblast proliferation, differentiation, and bone regeneration. This study focused on exploring the effects of different crosslinkers and bonding methods on the comprehensive properties of hydrogels. and proved that the hybrid scaffold system has good biocompatibility, cell barrier function and can enhance bone regeneration activity. Thereby it could be a promising clinical strategy for bone regeneration.",Journal of nanobiotechnology,eng,2023,Feb
Ultrafast Fabrication of Self-Healing and Injectable Carboxymethyl Chitosan Hydrogel Dressing for Wound Healing.,"Herein, a new type of injectable carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCh) hydrogel wound dressing with self-healing properties is constructed. First, CMCh samples are homogeneously synthesized in alkali/urea aqueous solutions. Subsequently, trivalent metal ions of Fe<sup>3+</sup> and Al<sup>3+</sup> are introduced to form coordination bonds with CMCh, leading to an ultrafast gelation process. A series of hydrogels can be obtained by altering the concentration of CMCh and the relative content of metal ions. Owing to the dynamic and reversible characteristics of the coordination bonds, the hydrogel exhibits self-healing, self-adaption, and thermoresponsive ability. Moreover, due to the interaction between the amino groups on CMCh and SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>, the hydrogel undergoes phase separation and can be painlessly detached from the skin with little residue. Taking advantage of all these characteristics, the hydrogel is used as a wound dressing and can significantly accelerate skin tissue regeneration and wound closure.

Tough and self-healing hydrogels based on transient crosslinking by nanoparticles.,"In this investigation, transient crosslinking was constructed to obtain a hydrogel with excellent mechanical and self-healing properties. Firstly, core-shell particles with hydrophilic amino groups were prepared by emulsion polymerization and subsequently dispersed into hydrophobic association polyacrylamide hydrogels. Transient crosslinking was constructed through hydrogen bonding between core-shell particles and polyacrylamide. As a result, the hydrogels exhibited a tensile strength of 1.4 MPa and self-healing efficiency of 98% at 24 h. Furthermore, reconstruction of the transient crosslinking was confirmed from rheological measurements. Therefore, the essential reinforcement principle based on transient crosslinking would open a novel strategy to obtain hydrogels with superior toughness and self-healing properties.",Soft matter,eng,2022,Mar
Metal-organic framework-based self-healing hydrogel fiber random lasers.,"Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), which have well-defined nanoporous skeletons and whose natural structure can work as optical resonant cavities, are emerging as ideal platforms for constructing micro/nanolasers. However, lasing generated from the light oscillating inside a defined MOFs' cavity usually suffers the drawback of the lasing performance being difficult to maintain once the cavity is destroyed. In this work, we report a MOF-based self-healing hydrogel fiber random laser (MOF-SHFRL) that can withstand extreme damage. The optical feedback of MOF-SHFRLs does not depend on the light reflection inside the MOF cavity but comes from the multiple scattering effects from the MOF nanoparticles (NPs). The hydrogel fiber's one-dimensional waveguide structure also permits confined directional lasing transmission. Based on such an ingenious design, a robust random lasing is achieved without worrying about the destruction of the MOF NPs. More interestingly, the MOF-SHFRL demonstrates excellent self-healing ability without any external stimulation: it can fully recover its initial morphology and lasing performance even when totally broken (<i>e.g.</i>, cut into two parts). The lasing threshold also remains stable, and the optical transmission capability can recover by more than 90% after multiple breaks and self-healing processes. These results indicate that the MOF-SHFRL is a highly stable optical device that can be expected to play a significant role in environmental monitoring, intelligent sensing, and other aspects under extreme conditions.",Nanoscale,eng,2023,Jun
Chemical signal regulated injectable coacervate hydrogels.,"In the quest for stimuli-responsive materials with specific, controllable functions, coacervate hydrogels have become a promising candidate, featuring sensitive responsiveness to environmental signals enabling control over sol-gel transitions. However, conventional coacervation-based materials are regulated by relatively non-specific signals, such as temperature, pH or salt concentration, which limits their possible applications. In this work, we constructed a coacervate hydrogel with a Michael addition-based chemical reaction network (CRN) as a platform, where the state of coacervate materials can be easily tuned by specific chemical signals. We designed a pyridine-based ABA triblock copolymer, whose quaternization can be regulated by an allyl acetate electrophile and an amine nucleophile, leading to gel construction and collapse in the presence of polyanions. Our coacervate gels showed not only highly tunable stiffness and gelation times, but excellent self-healing ability and injectability with different sized needles, and accelerated degradation resulting from chemical signal-induced coacervation disruption. This work is expected to be a first step in the realization of a new class of signal-responsive injectable materials.",Chemical science,eng,2023,Feb
"A simple pillar[5]arene assembled multi-functional material with ultrasensitive sensing, self-healing, conductivity and host-guest stimuli-responsive properties.","Multi-functional materials have received wide attention due to their potential applications in various fields; therefore, developing a simple and easy strategy for the preparation of multi-functional materials is an interesting issue. In this work, a novel supramolecular gel, TP-QG, has been successfully constructed <i>via</i> the assembly of a simple methoxyl-pillar[5]arene host (TP) and a tripodal (tri-pyridine-4-yl)-amido-benzene guest (Q). Interestingly, TP-QG could act as a multi-functional material and showed strong fluorescence, good self-healing, host-guest stimuli-responsiveness and conductive properties. Due to these properties, TP-QG shows a fascinating application prospect. For instance, TP-QG could exhibit ultrasensitive fluorescence response for Fe<sup>3+</sup> and F<sup>-</sup> in water <i>via</i> the fluorescence ""ON-OFF-ON"" pathway; the lowest detection limit (LOD) of TP-QG for Fe<sup>3+</sup> was 2.32 × 10<sup>-10</sup> M and the LOD of TP-QG-Fe for F<sup>-</sup> was 4.30 × 10<sup>-8</sup> M.

Physiological suitability of sulfate-reducing granules for the development of bioconcrete.,"Regular monitoring and timely repair of concrete cracks are required to minimize further deterioration. Self-healing of cracks has been proposed as an alternative to the crack maintenance procedures. One of the proposed techniques is to use axenic cultures to exploit microbial-induced calcite precipitation (MICP). However, such healing agents are not cost-effective for in situ use. As the market for bio-based self-healing concrete necessitates a low-cost bio-agent, nonaxenic sulfate reducing bacterial (SRB) granules were investigated in this study through cultivation in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor. The compact granules can protect the bacteria from adverse conditions without encapsulation. This study investigated the microbial activities of SRB granules at different temperatures, pH, and chemical oxygen demand concentrations which the microbes would experience during the concrete casting and curing process. The attenuation and recovery of microbial activities were measured before and after the exposure. Moreover, the MICP yield was also tested for a possible use in self-healing bioconcrete. The results consistently showed that SRB granules were able to survive starvation, high temperature (50-60°C), and high pH (12), together with scanning electron microscope/energy dispersive spectrometry/X-ray diffraction analysis evidence. Microbial staining analysis demonstrated the formation of spores in the granules during their exposure to harsh conditions. SRB granule was thus demonstrated to be a viable self-healing nonaxenic agent for low-cost bioconcrete.",Biotechnology and bioengineering,eng,2022,Oct

Immobilized bacteria with pH-response hydrogel for self-healing of concrete.,"Concrete is significant for construction. A problem in application is the appearance of cracks that will damage its strength. An autogenous crack-healing mechanism based on bacteria receives increasing attention in recent years. The bacteria are able to form calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) precipitations in suitable conditions to protect and reinforce the concrete. However, a large number of spores are crushed in aged specimens, resulting in a loss of viability. A new kind of hydrogel crosslinked by alginate, chitosan and calcium ions was introduced in this study. It was observed that the addition of chitosan improved the swelling properties of calcium alginate. Opposite pH response to calcium alginate was observed when the chitosan content in the solution reached 1.0%. With an addition of 1.0% chitosan in hydrogel beads, 10.28% increase of compressive strength and 13.79% increase of flexural strength to the control were observed. The results reveal self-healing properties of concretes. A healing crack of 4 cm length and 1 mm width was observed when using cement PO325, with the addition of bacterial spores (2.54-3.07 × 10<sup>5</sup>/cm<sup>3</sup> concrete) encapsulated by hydrogel containing no chitosan.",Journal of environmental management,eng,2020,May
Evaluation of the Self-Healing Ability of Mortar Mixtures Containing Superabsorbent Polymers and Nanosilica.,"Addition of superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) to cementitious mixtures promotes the self-healing ability of the material. When cracking occurs; SAPs present inside the crack will swell upon contact with water and subsequently release this water to stimulate the further hydration of unhydrated cement particles and the calcium carbonate crystallization. However; the inclusion of SAPs affects the mechanical performance of the cementitious material by the creation of macro-pores as water is retracted from the swollen SAP. To counteract the reduction in strength, part of the cement is replaced by nanosilica. In this research, different mixtures containing either SAPs or nanosilica and a combination of both were made. The samples were subjected to wet-dry cycles simulating external conditions, and the self-healing efficiency was evaluated by means of the evolution in crack width, by optical measurements, and a water permeability test. In samples containing SAPs, an immediate sealing effect was observed and visual crack closure was noticed. The smaller influence on the mechanical properties and the good healing characteristics in mixtures containing both nanosilica and SAPs are promising as a future material for use in building applications.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Jan

Insights into the Current Trends in the Utilization of Bacteria for Microbially Induced Calcium Carbonate Precipitation.,"Nowadays, microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) has received great attention for its potential in construction and geotechnical applications. This technique has been used in biocementation of sand, consolidation of soil, production of self-healing concrete or mortar, and removal of heavy metal ions from water. The products of MICP often have enhanced strength, durability, and self-healing ability. Utilization of the MICP technique can also increase sustainability, especially in the construction industry where a huge portion of the materials used is not sustainable. The presence of bacteria is essential for MICP to occur. Bacteria promote the conversion of suitable compounds into carbonate ions, change the microenvironment to favor precipitation of calcium carbonate, and act as precipitation sites for calcium carbonate crystals. Many bacteria have been discovered and tested for MICP potential. This paper reviews the bacteria used for MICP in some of the most recent studies. Bacteria that can cause MICP include ureolytic bacteria, non-ureolytic bacteria, cyanobacteria, nitrate reducing bacteria, and sulfate reducing bacteria. The most studied bacterium for MICP over the years is <i>Sporosarcina pasteurii</i>. Other bacteria from Bacillus species are also frequently investigated. Several factors that affect MICP performance are bacterial strain, bacterial concentration, nutrient concentration, calcium source concentration, addition of other substances, and methods to distribute bacteria. Several suggestions for future studies such as CO<sub>2</sub> sequestration through MICP, cost reduction by using plant or animal wastes as media, and genetic modification of bacteria to enhance MICP have been put forward.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Nov

Bio-mineralized self-healing recycled aggregate concrete for sustainable infrastructure.,"Various carriers have been investigated by researchers to introduce bacteria inside the concrete however, factors such as local availability, cost and long-term protection of bacterial cells have barred the application of this contemporary technology in the construction industry. In the present study, bacteria were immobilized via recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) and virgin fine aggregate (FA) besides direct induction to preserve natural resources and emulate sustainability. The application of RCA in substitution of virgin coarse aggregate is dropping anthropogenic emissions, minimizing energy consumption and managing construction waste effectively. Vegetative cells of Bacillus subtilis bacterium were incorporated in RCA through vacuum impregnation to boost crack healing efficiency. Crack healing efficiency was studied by quantifying the crack healing widths and percentage of strength regained after pre-cracking at 3,7 and 28 days. Similarly, mechanical properties were gauged via compressive and split tensile strengths at specified intervals while healing precipitate was characterized using analytical means. Results of experimental work revealed that specimens having RCA and 50% virgin FA as bacteria immobilizers exhibited the most efficient crack healing remedy by healing crack widths up to 1.1 mm and recovering 85% of compressive strength. Specimens containing RCA exclusively displayed a maximum of 0.7 mm crack healing widths and 76% strength recovery while direct incorporation of bacteria lagged behind with 0.6 mm crack healing width having 69% strength recovery. Likewise, synergetic formulation and direct induction depicted increase in compressive strength of 4% and 6% respectively while exclusive RCA formulation decreased the compressive strength up to 3% Moreover, field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray fluorescent (XRF) characterized the crack healing precipitate as bio-mineralized calcite crystals.",The Science of the total environment,eng,2020,Feb

Instantaneous self-healing and strongly adhesive self-adaptive hyaluronic acid-based hydrogel for controlled drug release to promote tendon wound healing.,"The treatment of tendon injuries is an important healthcare challenge. Irregular wounds, hypocellularity, and prolonged inflammation impede the rate of healing for tendon injuries. To address these problems, a high-tenacity shape-adaptive, mussel-like hydrogel (PH/GMs@bFGF&PDA) was designed and constructed with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and hyaluronic acid grafted with phenylboronic acid (BA-HA) by encapsulating polydopamine and gelatin microspheres containing basic fibroblast growth factor (GMs@bFGF). The shape-adaptive PH/GMs@bFGF&PDA hydrogel can quickly adapt to irregular tendon wounds, and the strong adhesion (101.46 ± 10.88 kPa) can keep the hydrogel adhered to the wound at all times. In addition, the high tenacity and self-healing properties allow the hydrogel to move with the tendon without fracture. Additionally, even if fractured, it can quickly self-heal and continue to adhere to the tendon wound, while slowly releasing basic fibroblast growth factor during the inflammatory phase of the tendon repair process, promoting cell proliferation, migration and shortening the inflammatory phase. In acute tendon injury and chronic tendon injury models, PH/GMs@bFGF&PDA significantly alleviated inflammation and promoted collagen I secretion, enhancing wound healing through the synergistic effects of its shape-adaptive and high-adhesion properties.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2023,Jul

However, it is very difficult and often contradictory to optimize them at one time. Here, a polyurethane (BS-PU-3) containing a polydisperse hard segment, hydrophobic soft segment, and a dynamic disulfide bond was prepared by one-pot synthesis. Unlike the normal two-pot reaction, BS-PU-3 obtained through the one-pot method owned a higher density of self-healing points along the main chain and a faster self-healing speed, which reached 1.11 μm/min in a cut-through sample and recovered more than 93% of virgin mechanical properties in 6 h at room temperature. Moreover, a remarkable toughness of 27.5 MJ/m<sup>3</sup> assures its durability as an e-skin matrix. Even with a 1 mm notch (half of the total width) on a standard dumbbell specimen, it could still bear the tensile strain up to 324% without any crack propagation. With polybutadiene as the soft segment, the shape, microstructure, and conductivity in BS-PU-3 and BS-PU-3-based stretchable electronics kept very stable after soaking in water for 3 days, proving the super waterproof property. An e-skin demo was constructed, and self-healing in pressure sensitivity, mechanical, and electrical properties were verified.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Mar
Gradient H-Bonding Supports Highly Adaptable and Rapidly Self-Healing Composite Binders with High Ionic Conductivity for Silicon Anodes in Lithium-Ion Batteries.,"An ideal binder for high-energy-density lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) should effectively inhibit volume effects, exhibit specific functional properties (e.g., self-repair capabilities and high ionic conductivity), and require low-cost, environmentally friendly mass production processes. This study adopts a synergistic strategy involving gradient (strong-weak) hydrogen bonding to construct a hard/soft polymer composite binder with self-healing abilities and high battery cell environments adaptability in LIBs. The meticulously designed 3D network structure comprising continuous electron transport pathways buffers the mechanical stresses caused by changes in silicon volume and improves the overall stability of the solid electrolyte interphase film. The Si-based anode with a polymer composite binder poly(acrylic acid-g-ureido pyrimidinone<sub>5%</sub> )/polyethylene oxide (Si/PAA-UPy<sub>5%</sub> /PEO) achieves a reversible capacity of 1245 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> after 200 cycles at 0.5 C, which is 6.6 times higher than that of the Si/PAA anode. After 200 cycles at 0.2 A g<sup>-1</sup> , a half-cell comprising Si/C anode with a polymer composite binder (Si/C/PAA-UPy<sub>5%</sub> /PEO) has a remaining specific capacity of 420 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> and a capacity retention rate of 79%. The corresponding full cell with a Li-based cathode (LiFePO<sub>4</sub> /Si/C/PAA-UPy<sub>5%</sub> /PEO) has an initial area capacity of 0.96 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup> and retains an area capacity of 0.90 mAh cm<sup>-2</sup> (capacity retention rate = 93%) after 100 cycles at 0.2 A g<sup>-1</sup> .",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2023,Mar
A Highly Efficient Self-Healing Elastomer with Unprecedented Mechanical Properties.,"It is highly desirable, although very challenging, to develop self-healable materials exhibiting both high efficiency in self-healing and excellent mechanical properties at ambient conditions. Herein, a novel Cu(II)-dimethylglyoxime-urethane-complex-based polyurethane elastomer (Cu-DOU-CPU) with synergetic triple dynamic bonds is developed. Cu-DOU-CPU demonstrates the highest reported mechanical performance for self-healing elastomers at room temperature, with a tensile strength and toughness up to 14.8 MPa and 87.0 MJ m<sup>-3</sup> , respectively. Meanwhile, the Cu-DOU-CPU spontaneously self-heals at room temperature with an instant recovered tensile strength of 1.84 MPa and a continuously increased strength up to 13.8 MPa, surpassing the original strength of all other counterparts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the coordination of Cu(II) plays a critical role in accelerating the reversible dissociation of dimethylglyoxime-urethane, which is important to the excellent performance of the self-healing elastomer. Application of this technology is demonstrated by a self-healable and stretchable circuit constructed from Cu-DOU-CPU.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2019,Jun
Hydrogen-bonding-supported self-healing antifogging thin films.,"Inspired by the repair of DNA through efficient reformation of hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), herein we report a facile one-step approach to construction of self-healing antifogging thin films on the basis of partly cross-linked poly(vinyl alcohol)(PVA) and poly(acrylic acid)(PAA). By designing the molar ratio of hydroxyl groups to carboxyl groups, the cross-linked polymer thin films maintain abundant free hydroxyl groups to present excellent antifogging property, which is derived from the hydrophilicity and hygroscopicity of the thin films. The thin films showed smart intrinsic self-healing characteristics towards wounds caused by external forces, which is attributed to sufficient free hydroxyl groups at the scratched interfaces to reform H-bonds across the interfaces and a sufficient chain mobility that is indispensable for chain diffusion across the interfaces and hydroxyl groups association to form H-bonds. No synthetic surfaces reported so far possess all the unique characteristics of the polymer thin films: intrinsic self-healing, long-term antifogging, excellent mechanical property, high transmittance and large-scale feasibility.",Scientific reports,eng,2015,Mar
"A self-healing, recyclable, and degradable fire-retardant gelatin-based biogel coating for green buildings.","Wood is one of the oldest building materials and commonly employed in construction. However, the inherent fire hazard of wood restricts its practical application. Application of fire retardant coatings has been proved to be a highly efficient method for improving the fire retardancy of structural materials during combustion. However, developing sustainable, renewable and environmentally-friendly coatings is challenging because of the dependence on traditional flame retardants. In this study, a self-healable, fully-recyclable and biodegradable biogel coating was proposed, derived entirely from natural and food-safe constituents, which has rarely been demonstrated for wood safety. A uniform and strongly-adhesive coating could be obtained on wood surfaces via a facile preparation process without compromising the inherent mechanical properties of wood. Meanwhile, the coating showed excellent self-healing properties after damage, full degradability and good recyclability when disposed. Remarkably, biogel-coated wood exhibited enhanced fire-retardant properties, reflected by a 24.0% decrease in peak heat release rate and 17.2% reduction in total heat release with a 350 μm thick coating, along with a sixfold enhancement in ignition delay time and self-extinguishing behavior. We merged all merits in one fire-retardant coating which can be easily reproduced, and is low cost and scalable, making the biogel-coated wood a promising candidate for widespread application in green buildings.",Soft matter,eng,2021,May
Prolonging Bacterial Viability in Biological Concrete: Coated Expanded Clay Particles.,"One of the biggest challenges in the development of a biological self-healing concrete is to ensure the long-term viability of bacteria that are embedded in the concrete. In the present study, a coated expanded clay (EC) is investigated for its potential use as a bacterial carrier in biological concrete. Eight different materials for coatings were selected considering cost, workability and accessibility in the construction industry. Long-term (56 days) viability analysis was conducted with a final evaluation of each coating performance. Our results indicate that healing efficiency in biological concrete specimens is strongly related to viable bacteria present in the healing agent. More viable bacteria-containing specimens exhibited a higher crack closure ratio. Our data suggest that the additional coating of EC particles improves long-term bacterial viability and, consequently, provides efficient crack healing in biological concrete.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,May
Self-healing efficiency of cementitious materials containing microcapsules filled with healing adhesive: mechanical restoration and healing process monitored by water absorption.,"Autonomous crack healing of cementitious composite, a construction material that is susceptible to cracking, is of great significance to improve the serviceability and to prolong the longevity of concrete structures. In this study, the St-DVB microcapsules enclosing epoxy resins as the adhesive agent were embedded in cement paste to achieve self-healing capability. The self-healing efficiency was firstly assessed by mechanical restoration of the damaging specimens after being matured. The flexural and compressive configurations were both used to stimulate the localized and distributed cracks respectively. The effects of some factors, including the content of microcapsules, the curing conditions and the degree of damage on the healing efficiency were investigated. Water absorption was innovatively proposed to monitor and characterize the evolution of crack networks during the healing process. The healing cracks were observed by SEM-EDS following. The results demonstrated that the capsule-containing cement paste can achieve the various mechanical restorations depending on the curing condition and the degree of damage. But the voids generated by the surfactants compromised the strength. Though no noticeable improved stiffness obtained, the increasing fracture energy was seen particularly for the specimen acquiring 60% pre-damage. The sorptivity and amount of water decreased with cracks healing by the adhesive, which contributed to cut off and block ingress of water. The micrographs by SEM-EDS also validated that the cracks were bridged by the hardened epoxy as the dominated elements of C and O accounted for 95% by mass in the nearby cracks.",PloS one,eng,2013,No Data
The Effect of Exposure on the Autogenous Self-Healing of Ordinary Portland Cement Mortars.,"Exposure conditions are critical for the autogenous self-healing process of Portland cement based binder matrixes. However, there is still a significant lack of fundamental knowledge related to this factor. The aim of this paper was to investigate and understand the effects of various potentially applicable curing solutions on the efficiency of the crack closure occurring both superficially and internally. Four groups of exposures were tested, including exposure with different water immersion regimes, variable temperatures, application of chemical admixtures, and use of solutions containing micro particles. The self-healing process was evaluated externally, at the surface of the crack, and internally, at different crack depths with the use of optical and scanning electron microscopes (SEM). The phase identification was done with an energy dispersive spectrometer combined with the SEM. The results showed very limited self-healing in all pure water-based exposures, despite the application of different cycles, temperatures, and water volumes. The addition of a phosphate-based retarding admixture demonstrated the highest crack closure, both internally and externally. The highest strength recovery and a very good crack closure ratio was achieved in water exposure containing micro silica particles. The main phase observed on the surface was calcium carbonate, and internally, calcium silicate hydrate, calcium carbonate, and calcium phosphate compounds. Phosphate ions were found to contribute to the filling of the crack, most likely by preventing the formation of a dense shell composed of hydration phases on the exposed areas by crack unhydrated cement grains as well as by the additional precipitation of calcium and phosphate-based compounds. The micro sized silica particles presumably served as nucleation sites for the self-healing products growth. Changes in the chemical composition of the self-healing material were observed with a distance from the surface of the specimen.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2019,Nov
Artificial Photosynthesis at Efficiencies Greatly Exceeding That of Natural Photosynthesis.,"Sunlight is an abundant energy source for a sustainable society. Indeed, photosynthetic organisms harness solar radiation to build the world around us by synthesizing energy-rich compounds from water and CO<sub>2</sub>. However, numerous energy conversion bottlenecks in the natural system limits the overall efficiency of photosynthesis; the most efficient plants do not exceed solar storage efficiencies of 1%. Artificial photosynthetic solar-to-fuels cycles may occur at higher intrinsic efficiencies, but they typically terminate at hydrogen, with no process installed to complete the cycle for carbon fixation. This limitation may be overcome by interfacing solar-driven water splitting to H<sub>2</sub>-oxidizing microorganisms. To this end, hybrid biological-inorganic constructs have been created to use sunlight, air, and water as the only starting materials to accomplish carbon fixation in the form of biomass and liquid fuels. This artificial photosynthetic cycle begins with the Artificial Leaf, which accomplishes the solar process of natural photosynthesis-the splitting of water to hydrogen and oxygen using sunlight-under ambient conditions. To create the Artificial Leaf, an oxygen evolving complex of Photosystem II was mimicked, the most important property of which was the self-healing nature of the catalyst. Self-healing catalysts permit water splitting to be accomplished using any water source, which is the critical development for (1) the Artificial Leaf, as it allows for the facile interfacing of water splitting catalysis to materials such as silicon, and (2) the hybrid biological-inorganic construct, called the Bionic Leaf, as it allows for the facile interfacing of water splitting catalysis to bioorganisms. Hydrogenases in the bioorganism allow the hydrogen to be coupled to NADPH and ATP production, thus allowing the solar energy from water splitting to be converted into cellular energy to drive cellular biosynthesis. In the design of the hybrid system, water splitting catalysts must be designed that support hydrogen generation at low applied potential to ensure a high energy efficiency while avoiding reactive oxygen species. Using the tools of synthetic biology, a bioengineered bacterium, <i>Ralstonia eutropha</i>, converts carbon dioxide from air, along with the hydrogen produced from such catalysts of the Artificial Leaf, into biomass and liquid fuels, thus closing an entire artificial photosynthetic cycle. The Bionic Leaf operates at solar-to-biomass and solar-to-liquid fuels efficiencies that greatly exceed the highest solar-to-biomass efficiencies of natural photosynthesis.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2019,Nov
"Mussel-Inspired Multifunctional Hydrogels with Adhesive, Self-Healing, Antioxidative, and Antibacterial Activity for Wound Healing.","Antibacterial hydrogel wound dressings with adhesive and antioxidant activity are desirable for treating skin injuries in clinical care. Hereby, a series of multifunctional hydrogel wound dressings with high adhesive, self-healing, antioxidant, and antibacterial activity were designed and fabricated using dopamine (DA) and quercetin (QT). The multifunctional hydrogels were constructed by the interpenetrated quaternized chitosan chain segments and polyacrylamide network. The catechol groups on DA, QT, and the quaternary ammonium groups in the hydrogel system endow hydrogels with high strength, excellent adhesion, and self-healing ability. The results confirmed the admirable hemocompatibility and remarkable antibacterial activity of the multifunction hydrogels against <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> and <i>Escherichia coli</i>. Consequently, multifunction hydrogels with satisfactory adhesive and antibacterial activity are appropriate alternative materials in the fields of tissue adhesive and wound dressing applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,Apr

Furthermore, CD31 conjugated with ɛ-polylysine (Plys) to construct injectable, and self-healing hydrogel (CD-Plys) that possess the advantages of remarkable broad spectrum antibacterial activity, excellent wound healing ability and satisfied biocompatibility. CD-Plys could dramatically accelerate wound healing with epithelization and enhanced angiogenesis.

Tough Self-Healing Elastomers Based on the Host-Guest Interaction of Polycyclodextrin.,"Inspired by animal muscles, we developed a kind of tough elastomers combining high strength and high stretchability with autonomous self-healing capability. A key structural feature is the construction of a double network (DN) connected by the hydrogen bond and host-guest interactions. The first network is the classic elastomer polyacrylate matrix cross-linked by strong hydrogen bonding. The second network is formed through the host-guest interactions between polycyclodextrin and the adamantane (Ad) groups on the side of the polyacrylate chain. Supramolecular interactions between two networks make them miscible and interpenetrate in the molecular level and then can share the load as the sample was stretched. The host-guest interactions act not only as sacrificial bonds for energy dissipation but also as self-healing driving forces. The tensile strength of the DN elastomer reaches about 6.7 MPa and the strain is as high as about 950%. The DN elastomer can be easy to repair by touching the damaged surface together at ambient conditions when broken or cut. The recovered tensile strength can reach over 4.5 MPa, which is better than the most pristine strength of existing spontaneous self-healing elastomers.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2019,Mar
Light triggered interfacial damage self-healing of poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) fiber composites.,"The interfacial microcracks in the resin matrix composites are difficult to be detected and repaired. However, the self-healing concept provides opportunities to fabricate composites with unusual properties. In the present study, photothermal conversion Ag-Cu<sub>2</sub>S nanoparticles were immobilized onto poly(p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers via a polydopamine chemistry. Benefitting from the photothermal effects of Ag-Cu<sub>2</sub>S, the obtained PBO fibers (Ag-Cu<sub>2</sub>S-PBO) efficiently converted the light energy into heat under Xenon lamp irradiation. Then, single PBO fiber composites were prepared using thermoplastic polyurethane as the matrix. It was found that the interfacial damage caused by single fiber pull-out was simply self-healed by Xe light irradiation. This wonderful interfacial damage self-healing property was mainly attributed to the in situ heating generation via photothermal effects of Ag-Cu<sub>2</sub>S in the composite interface. This paper reports a novel strategy to construct advanced composites with light-triggered self-healing properties, which will provide inspiration for preparing high performance composite materials.",Nanotechnology,eng,2018,May
Supramolecular self-healing materials from non-covalent cross-linking host-guest interactions.,"The introduction of non-covalent bonds is effective for achieving self-healing properties because they can be controlled reversibly. One approach to introduce these bonds into supramolecular materials is use of host-guest interactions. This feature article summarizes the development of supramolecular materials constructed by non-covalent cross-linking through several approaches, such as host-guest interactions between host polymers and guest polymers, 1 : 2-type host-guest interactions, and host-guest interactions from the polymerization of host-guest inclusion complexes. Host-guest interactions show self-healing functions while also enabling stimuli-responsiveness (redox, pH, and temperature). The self-healing function of supramolecular materials is achieved by stress dispersion arising from host-guest interactions when stress is applied. Reversible bonds based on host-guest interactions have tremendous potential to expand the variety of functional materials.","Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",eng,2020,Apr
Effective Crack Control of Concrete by Self-Healing of Cementitious Composites Using Synthetic Fiber.,"Although concrete is one of the most widely used construction materials, it is characterized by substantially low tensile strength in comparison to its compression strength, and the occurrence of cracks is unavoidable. In addition, cracks progress due to environmental conditions including damage by freezing, neutralization, and salt, <i>etc.</i> Moreover, detrimental damage can occur in concrete structures due to the permeation of deteriorating elements such as Cl<sup>-</sup> and CO₂. Meanwhile, under an environment in which moisture is being supplied and if the width of the crack is small, a phenomenon of self-healing, in which a portion of the crack is filled in due to the rehydration of the cement particles and precipitation of CaCO₃, is been confirmed. In this study, cracks in cementitious composite materials are effectively dispersed using synthetic fibers, and for cracks with a width of more than 0.1 mm, a review of the optimal self-healing conditions is conducted along with the review of a diverse range of self-healing performance factors. As a result, it was confirmed that the effective restoration of watertightness through the production of the majority of self-healing products was achieved by CaCO₃ and the use of synthetic fibers with polarity, along with the effect of inducing a multiple number of hairline cracks. In addition, it was confirmed that the self-healing conditions of saturated Ca(OH)₂ solution, which supplied CO₂ micro-bubbles, displayed the most effective self-healing performance in the surface and internal sections of the cracks.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2016,Mar
Green Conductive Hydrogel Electrolyte with Self-Healing Ability and Temperature Adaptability for Flexible Supercapacitors.,"Conductive hydrogels (CHs) are ideal electrolyte materials for the preparation of flexible supercapacitors (FSCs) due to their excellent electrochemical properties, mechanical properties, and deformation restorability. However, most of the reported CHs are prepared by the chemical crosslinking of synthetic polymers and thus usually display the disadvantages of poor self-healing abilities and nonadaptability at environmental temperatures, which greatly limits their application. To overcome these problems, in the present work, we constructed a sodium alginate-borax/gelatin double-network conductive hydrogel (CH) by a dynamic crosslinking between sodium alginate (SA) and borax via borate bonds and hydrogen bonding between amino acids in gelatin and SA chains. The CH displays an excellent elongation of 305.7% and fast self-healing behavior in 60 s. Furthermore, a phase-change material (PCM), Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>·10H<sub>2</sub>O, was introduced into the CH, which, combined with the nucleation effect of borax, improved the ionic conductivity and temperature adaptability of the CH. The flexible supercapacitor (FSC) assembled with the obtained CH as the electrolyte exhibits a high specific capacitance of 185.3 F·g<sup>-1</sup> at a current density of 0.25 A·g<sup>-1</sup> and good stability with 84% capacitance retention after 10 000 cycles and excellent temperature tolerance with a resistance variation of 2.11 Ω in the temperature range of -20-60 °C. This green CH shows great application potential as an electrolyte for FSCs, and the preparation method can be potentially expanded to the fabrication of self-repairing FSCs with good temperature adaptabilities.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Aug
Vertical Barriers for Land Contamination Containment: A Review.,"Soil pollution is one of the major threats to the environment and jeopardizes the provision of key soil ecosystem services.

This paper comprehensively reviewed and assessed the typical materials and mechanical and permeability properties of soil-bentonite, cement-bentonite and soil mix barriers, with the values of mix design and engineering properties summarized and compared. In addition, the damage and durability of barrier materials under mechanical, chemical, and environmental stresses were discussed. A number of landmark remediation projects were documented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the use of barrier systems. Recent research about crack-resistant and self-healing barrier materials incorporating polymers and minerals at Cambridge University and performance monitoring techniques were analyzed.

Molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) nanosheets-based hydrogels with light-triggered self-healing property for flexible sensors.,"The fabrication of flexible electronic sensors with self-healing capability is of great importance for the applications in wearable devices and skin-like electronics. Herein, a molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) nanosheets-based hydrogel (Gel-PEG-MoS<sub>2</sub>, GPM hydrogel), with near infrared (NIR) light-induced self-healing property, was first reported as a flexible sensor. Only a small amount of MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets (0.04 wt‰) could impart the hydrogel with fast self-healing property under NIR irradiation in 90 s. The healing efficiencies increased with the increasing of MoS<sub>2</sub> loadings. Moreover, the GPM hydrogel exhibited both contact and noncontact sensing properties based on its deformation-dependent and light-sensitive conductivity, showing potential application as mechanical sensor and light-activated switches. By employing the versatile MoS<sub>2</sub> nanosheets, the hydrogel exhibited both fast self-healing ability and mechanical/light sensing capability. Therefore, the MoS<sub>2</sub>-based hydrogel provides a two-pronged approach for construction of self-healing flexible electronics.",Journal of colloid and interface science,eng,2021,Mar
Constructing Electrically and Mechanically Self-Healing Elastomers by Hydrogen Bonded Intermolecular Network.,"One key limitation of artificial skin-like materials is the shortened service life caused by mechanical damages during practical applications. The ability to self-heal can effectively extend the material service life, reduce the maintenance cost, and ensure safety. Therefore, it is important and necessary to fabricate materials with simultaneously mechanical and electrical self-healing behavior in a facile and convenient way. Herein, we report a stretchable and conductive self-healing elastomer based on intermolecular networks between poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) through a facile and convenient postreduction and one-pot method. The introduction of rGO provides the PAA-GO elastomers with good mechanical stability and electrical properties. Moreover, this material exhibited both electrical and mechanical self-healing properties. After cutting, the elastomers self-healed quickly (∼30 s) and efficiently (∼95%) at room temperature.

Supramolecular Nested Microbeads as Building Blocks for Macroscopic Self-Healing Scaffolds.,"The ability to construct self-healing scaffolds that are injectable and capable of forming a designed morphology offers the possibility to engineer sustainable materials. Herein, we introduce supramolecular nested microbeads that can be used as building blocks to construct macroscopic self-healing scaffolds. The core-shell microbeads remain in an ""inert"" state owing to the isolation of a pair of complementary polymers in a form that can be stored as an aqueous suspension. An annealing process after injection effectively induces the re-construction of the microbead units, leading to supramolecular gelation in a preconfigured shape. The resulting macroscopic scaffold is dynamically stable, displaying self-recovery in a self-healing electronic conductor. This strategy of using the supramolecular assembled nested microbeads as building blocks represents an alternative to injectable hydrogel systems, and shows promise in the field of structural biomaterials and flexible electronics.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),eng,2018,Mar
Hydroxyl-Terminated Polybutadiene-Based Polyurethane with Self-Healing and Reprocessing Capabilities.,"Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-based polyurethane (PU) networks play indispensable roles in a variety of applications; however, they cannot be reprocessed, resulting in environmental problems and unsustainable industrial development. In this work, recyclable HTPB-based PU vitrimer (HTPB-PU<sub>V</sub>) networks are fabricated by introduction of a cross-linker 2,2'-(1,4-phenylene)-bis[4-mercaptan-1,3,2-dioxaborolane] (BDB) with dynamic boronic ester bonds into the network. Meanwhile, the BDB can stabilize the HTPB unit in the network by elimination of double bonds. The novel HTPB-PU<sub>V</sub> networks are constructed by a thiol-ene ""click"" reaction and an addition reaction between HTPB and cross-linker BDB and isocyanates (HDI). The dynamic HTPB-PU<sub>V</sub> networks are characterized by dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR). The obtained dynamic HTPB-PU<sub>V</sub> networks possess superior thermostability. Moreover, due to the presence of dynamic boronic ester bonds, the HTPB-PU<sub>V</sub> network topologies can be altered, contributing to the reprocessing, self-healing, and welding abilities of the final polymer. Through a hot press, the pulverized sample can be reprocessed for several cycles, and mechanical properties of the reprocessed samples are similar to those of the pristine one, with the tensile strength being even higher. The self-healed sample exhibits almost complete recovery from scratch after the healing treatment at 130 °C for 3 h. Moreover, a welding efficiency of 120% was achieved.",ACS omega,eng,2022,Mar
Recent Progress in Fabrication and Applications of Superhydrophobic Coating on Cellulose-Based Substrates.,"Multifuntional fabrics with special wettability have attracted a lot of interest in both fundamental research and industry applications over the last two decades.

An injectable self-healing hydrogel-cellulose nanocrystals conjugate with excellent mechanical strength and good biocompatibility.,"In this work, a novel strategy for the construction of injectable self-healing nanocomposite (NC) hydrogels dominated by reversible boronic ester bonds was demonstrated. Specifically, NC hydrogels were constructed by the solution-mixing of N,N-dimethylacrylamide-stat-3-acrylamidophenylboronicacid statistical copolymers (PDMA-stat-PAPBA) and poly(glycerolmonomethacrylate) (PGMA) chains grafted cellulose nanocrystals (CNC-g-PGMA). Rheology analysis indicated the as-constructed NC hydrogel displayed about 7-fold increase in the storage modulus with a low CNCs loading level of 1.43 wt% in comparison with PGMA/PDMA-stat-PAPBA hydrogel without CNCs. Furthermore, the mechanical strength of the CNC-g-PGMA/PDMA-stat-PAPBA hydrogel was far superior to that of its PGMA/PDMA-stat-PAPBA/CNCs hydrogel counterpart, in which PGMA chains were not covalently grafted on the surfaces of CNCs. Due to reversible boronic ester bonds cross-linking networks, CNC-g-PGMA/PDMA-stat-PAPBA NC hydrogel exhibited excellent self-healing and injectable properties as well as pH/glucose responsive sol-gel transitions. Good biocompatibility was also demonstrated through in vitro cytotoxicity tests.",Carbohydrate polymers,eng,2019,Nov

This opinion article discusses 3D printing in suspension baths as a novel strategy capable of disrupting the current bioprinting landscape. Suspension baths provide a semisolid medium to print into, voiding many of the inherent flaws of printing onto a flat surface in air. We review the state-of-the-art of this approach and extrapolate toward future possibilities that this technology might bring, including the fabrication of vascularized tissue constructs.",Trends in biotechnology,eng,2020,Jun
Full-Scale Use of Microwave Heating in Construction of Longitudinal Joints and Crack Healing in Asphalt Pavements.,"Asphalt pavement construction technology is an industry branch that undergoes constant development. Analyzing the directions of the development, one can divide it into two mainstreams: the development of roadworks equipment and the development of roadworks technology. Microwave heating technique has been mentioned in the road industry from the early '70s, but research records from practical full-scale use are very rare. This article presents the evaluation of the possible use of microwave heating technique during a particular aspect of the construction process, namely, the formation of longitudinal joints and the potential repair process of the cracked asphalt pavement. Research results showed that joints constructed using microwave-assisted heating performed the same or even better with regards to tensile characteristics comparing to other techniques. Also, the highest level of compaction was reached among the other tested techniques applied to the wearing course level. The second part of the research experiment showed the large potential of the microwave crack healing technique. The asphalt pavement was healed on its full depth of 10 cm with the single healing operation applied. Although some limitations may occur in the practical use of microwave heating, the test results suggest that it is a very promising technique and should be further developed (for, e.g., shielding concerns, electricity supply). The microwave heating technique is powered with electricity, which is important when there is a constant need for further reductions of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. It can be reached in parallel with clean energy or clean electricity sources.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Sep

Evaluation of Methodologies for Assessing Self-Healing Performance of Concrete with Mineral Expansive Agents: An Interlaboratory Study.,"Self-healing concrete has the potential to optimise traditional design approaches; however, commercial uptake requires the ability to harmonize against standardized frameworks. Within EU SARCOS COST Action, different interlaboratory tests were executed on different self-healing techniques. This paper reports on the evaluation of the effectiveness of proposed experimental methodologies suited for self-healing concrete with expansive mineral additions. Concrete prisms and discs with MgO-based healing agents were produced and precracked. Water absorption and water flow tests were executed over a healing period spanning 6 months to assess the sealing efficiency, and the crack width reduction with time was monitored. High variability was reported for both reference (REF) and healing-addition (ADD) series affecting the reproducibility of cracking. However, within each lab, the crack width creation was repeatable. ADD reported larger crack widths. The latter influenced the observed healing making direct comparisons across labs prone to errors. Water absorption tests highlighted were susceptible to application errors. Concurrently, the potential of water flow tests as a facile method for assessment of healing performance was shown across all labs. Overall, the importance of repeatability and reproducibility of testing methods is highlighted in providing a sound basis for incorporation of self-healing concepts in practical applications.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Apr
Double-network hydrogels with superior self-healing properties using starch reinforcing strategy.,"Constructing hybrid double network (DN) hydrogels has become an important strategy to prepare strong and tough hydrogels with good self-healing properties for durable usage. However, the recoverable and self-healing efficiencies of DN hydrogels are usually low. We develop a type of hybrid DN hydrogel, which contain the starch network for generating strong dynamic interactions within the gel matrix. The composite gels show tensile strength over 200 kPa with the elastic modulus of ∼29.7 kPa. Gelatinization of cassava starch is a key procedure that can significantly raise mechanical strengths. The healing efficiency of the composite gel gradually increased to as high as 99 % after 24 h at room temperature. This work shows that dynamic physical bonding in hydrogels can be greatly enhanced by a simple starch reinforcing tactic. The combination of naturally abundant starch with hydrophilic polymers provides a general approach to design functional soft materials for applications in various fields.",Carbohydrate polymers,eng,2021,Apr
A facile strategy to construct biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol)-based self-healing hydrogels.,"Endowing polymer hydrogels with good self-healing ability can autonomously repair damage with improved reliability. In this work, the benzaldehyde group was first grafted onto a biocompatible poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) molecular chain by esterification to obtain aldehyde-functionalized PVA (APVA), and the reversible imine bonds were further formed by reacting with amine groups on a quaternized chitosan (HTCC) chain. And thus, the self-healing APVA/HTCC hydrogel was fabricated with such imine bonds as crosslinking points together with hydrogen bonds. Many more imine bonds of hydrogels formed with increasing aldehyde content, resulting in increasing crosslinking density, decreasing average pore diameter and formation of a compact dynamic network, imparting certain mechanical strength and toughness with hydrogels. Furthermore, the healing efficiency of the hydrogel reached as high as 91.7% by self-healing without any external stimulus and its microstructure could be reconstructed after damage, exhibiting rapid recovery and dynamic features. Biocompatible self-healing PVA-based hydrogels exhibited great potential application in biomedical fields, like smart infill biomaterials, tissue engineering scaffolds, <i>etc.</i>",Soft matter,eng,2022,Sep
Glucose-sensitive self-healing hydrogel as sacrificial materials to fabricate vascularized constructs.,"A major challenge in tissue engineering is the lack of proper vascularization. Although various approaches have been used to build vascular network in a tissue engineering construct, there remain some drawbacks. Herein, a glucose-sensitive self-healing hydrogel are employed as sacrificial materials to fabricate branched tubular channels within a construct. The hydrogel composes of mainly reversibly crosslinked poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate and dithiothreitol with borax as the glucose-sensitive motif. The hydrogel is injectable and mechanically strong after injection. Moreover, it can be rapidly removed by immersion in the cell culture medium. To show the feasibility in building a vascularized tissue construct, the designed branching vascular patterns of the glucose-sensitive hydrogel are extruded and embedded in a non glucose-sensitive hydrogel containing neural stem cells. Vascular endothelial cells seeded in the lumen of the channels by perfusion can line the channel wall and migrate into the non-sacrificial hydrogel after 3 days. In long-term (∼14 days), the endothelial cells form capillary-like structure (vascular network) while neural stem cells form neurosphere-like structure (neural development) in the construct, revealing the morphology of ""a vascularized neural tissue"". The novel sacrificial materials can create complicated but easily removable structure for building a vascularized tissue construct particularly a neurovascular unit.",Biomaterials,eng,2017,Jul
"Conductive, Self-Healing, Adhesive, and Antibacterial Hydrogels Based on Lignin/Cellulose for Rapid MRSA-Infected Wound Repairing.","The abuse of antibiotics induces the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria, which greatly increases the difficulty of clinical treatment of infected wounds. It is urgent to design a multifunctional wound dressing independent of antibiotics. In this work, we designed multifunctional hydrogels based on lignin and cellulose in natural polymers. Lignin with antioxidant properties could reduce silver nanoparticles <i>in situ</i> and could also be used as a crosslinking agent to construct hydrogels between hydroxypropyl cellulose modified with phenylboric acid by a dynamic borate bond. Hydrogels have excellent properties such as self-healing, shape adaptability, biocompatibility, blood compatibility, antioxidant properties, excellent broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, good tissue adhesion, and electrical conductivity. The tissue adhesion of hydrogels endows them with an excellent hemostasis property in a rat liver injury model. <i>In vivo</i> experiments demonstrated that hydrogels can maintain a moist healing environment, reduce inflammatory cell infiltration, promote M2 macrophage polarization, accelerate collagen deposition, promote the regeneration of new blood vessels, and significantly speed up the wound healing of methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA)-infected wounds. Therefore, these multifunctional hydrogels are an excellent candidate to treat multiple stages of wound healing and have a broad application prospect in the medical field.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Nov
Strain Screening and Particle Formation: a Lysinibacillus boronitolerans for Self-Healing Concrete.,"Microbial-induced calcite precipitation is a promising technology to solve the problem of cracks in soil concrete. The most intensively investigated microorganisms are urease-producing bacteria. Lysinibacillus that is used as urease-producing bacteria in concrete repair has rarely been reported. In this study, Lysinibacillus boronitolerans with a high urease activity was isolated from soil samples. This strain is salt- and alkali-tolerance, and at pH 13, can grow to ~OD<sub>600</sub> 2.0 after 24 h. At a salt concentration of 6%, the strain can still grow to ~OD<sub>600</sub> 1.0 after 24 h. The feasibility of using this strain in self-healing concrete was explored. The data showed that cracks within ~0.6 mm could be repaired naturally with hydration when spores and substrates were added to the concrete in an appropriate proportion. Moreover, the number and morphology of CaCO<sub>3</sub> crystals that were produced by bacteria can be influenced by the concrete environment. An efficiency method to elucidate the process of microbial-induced calcium carbonate crystal formation was established with Particle Track G400. This study provides a template for future studies on the theory of mineralization based on microorganisms. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> The formation of calcium carbonate crystals in concrete by urease-producing bacteria is not understood fully. In this study, a Lysinibacillus boronitolerans strain with a high urease activity was isolated and used to analyze the counts and sizes of the crystals and the relationship with time. The data showed that the number of crystal particles increases exponentially in a short period with sufficient substrate, after which the crystals grow, precipitate or break. In concrete, the rate-limiting steps of calcium carbonate crystal accumulation are spore germination and urease production. These results provided data support for the rational design of urease-producing bacteria in concrete repair.",Applied and environmental microbiology,eng,2022,Sep
"Adhesive, Antibacterial, Conductive, Anti-UV, Self-Healing, and Tough Collagen-Based Hydrogels from a Pyrogallol-Ag Self-Catalysis System.","Recently, versatile hydrogels with multifunctionality have been widely developed with emerging applications as wearable and implantable devices. In this work, we reported novel versatile hydrogels by self-catalyzing the gelation of an interpenetrating polymer network consisting of acrylic acid (AA) monomers and GA-modified collagen (GCOL) in situ decorated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The resultant hydrogel, namely AgNP@GCOL/PAA, has many desirable features, including good mechanical properties (such as 123 kPa, 916%, and 1961 J m<sup>-2</sup> for the fracture stress, strain and tearing energy) that match with those of animal skin, excellent self-healing performance, favorable conductivity and strain sensitivity as a flexible biosensor, and excellent antibacterial and anti-UV properties, as well as the strong adhesiveness on skin. Moreover, AgNP@GCOL/PAA showed excellent biocompatibility via in vitro cell culture. Remarkably, AgNP@GCOL/PAA displayed superior hemostatic properties with sharply decreasing blood loss for a mouse liver incision, closely related to its strong self-adhesion which produced anchoring strength to the bleeding site and thus formed a network barrier with liver tissue.

Effect and Mechanism of Encapsulation-Based Spores on Self-Healing Concrete at Different Curing Ages.,"It has become an intelligent and environmental protection method to repair concrete cracks based on microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP). However, due to the high-alkali environment in concrete, even the microbial spores with strong alkali resistance find it difficult to survive for a long time, which affects the long-term self-healing effect of concrete cracks. In this paper, low-alkali sulfo-aluminate cement (SC) was used as a carrier to encapsulate spores, and the effects of the spore group and microbial group on the basic performances of concrete were studied. Then, the area repair ratio, water permeability, the repair ratio of anti-chloride ion penetration, and ultrasonic velocity were used to evaluate the self-healing efficiency of cracks, and the self-healing effects of two kinds of microbial self-healing agents on concrete cracks with different curing ages were further studied. Moreover, the growth, enzyme activity, and microbial morphologies of spores with and without encapsulation immersed in the simulated pore solution of cement-based materials at different times were studied to discuss the protective effect of the carrier on spores. Compared with the reference group, the results showed that the addition of two microbial self-healing agents would slightly affect the basic performances of concrete, but both were within the control range of concrete materials. For the early-age cracks, the two kinds of microbial self-healing agents could achieve a good self-healing effect, but for the later-age cracks, the concrete cracks of the microbial group could still be repaired well, while the self-healing effect of the spore group was greatly reduced. Moreover, the white precipitates generated at the crack mouth were all calcite CaCO<sub>3</sub>. In addition, the self-healing mechanism of different microbial self-healing agents on concrete cracks was discussed carefully. This study provides a new idea and method for the engineering application of microbial self-healing concrete.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Nov
"Strong, Healable, Stimulus-Responsive Fluorescent Elastomers Based on Assembled Borate Dynamic Nanostructures.","Self-healing materials integrated with robust mechanical property and fascinating functions synchronously hold great prospects in many applications, but it still remains a grand challenge.

The BDN is optimized to construct dense and strong interfacial boronic easter crosslinks, endowing the elastomer with outstanding stretchability (2050%), high strength (17.9 MPa) as well as healing efficiency (77.1%).

Collagen-based injectable and self-healing hydrogel with multifunction for regenerative repairment of infected wounds.,"At present, the development trend of dressing materials is being multifunctional for convenient and long-term nursing care process of some complicated wounds. Here, basing on the theory of wound moist healing, an injectable and self-healing hydrogel comprising of collagen (COL), chitosan (CS) and oxidation modified Konjac glucomannan (OKGM), which acts as a macromolecular cross-linker to construct dynamic Schiff-base bonds was smartly designed. The strategy of introducing the silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) into the COL-CS-OKGM hydrogel matrix achieved a markedly enhanced antibacterial activity derived from the synergistical effect between the Ag<sup>+</sup> and the mild photothermal efficacy of Ag NPs, which also improved the local capillary blood circulation of the wound area to further facilitate wound healing process. The excellent syringeability and self-healing behaviors endowed the COL-CS-OKGM-Ag hydrogel with self-adapting ability for the wounds with irregular and large area needing frequent applying and changing without secondary injuries. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> evaluations verified that so-designed COL-CS-OKGM-Ag hydrogel also with hemostatic performance is a promising multifunctional dressing for the treatments of infected wound with not only good biocompatibility and convenient use, but also with desired regenerative healing prognoses benefited from hydrogel moist environment and physiotherapy.",Regenerative biomaterials,eng,2023,No Data
Three-Dimensional Printing Self-Healing Dynamic/Photocrosslinking Gelatin-Hyaluronic Acid Double-Network Hydrogel for Tissue Engineering.,"Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology has great potential for constructing structurally and functionally complex scaffold materials for tissue engineering. Bio-inks are a critical part of 3D printing for this purpose. In this study, based on dynamic hydrazone-crosslinked hyaluronic acid (HA-HYD) and photocrosslinked gelatin methacrylate (GelMA), a double-network (DN) hydrogel with significantly enhanced mechanical strength, self-healing, and shear-thinning properties was developed as a printable hydrogel bio-ink for extrusion-based 3D printing. Owing to shear thinning, the DN hydrogel bio-inks could be extruded to form uniform filaments, which were printed layer by layer to fabricate the scaffolds. The self-healing performance of the filaments and photocrosslinking of GelMA worked together to obtain an integrated and stable printed structure with high mechanical strength. The <i>in vitro</i> cytocompatibility assay showed that the DN hydrogel printed scaffolds supported the survival and proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells.

Three-dimensional printing of hyaluronate-based self-healing ferrogel with enhanced stretchability.,"Hydrogels have been frequently employed for three-dimensional (3D) printing, which is a promising tool for fabricating sophisticated structures useful in many biomedical applications. Ferrogels prepared by combining magnetic nanoparticles with hydrogels also have potential in biomedical engineering because of the responsiveness to a magnetic field and remotely controllable properties. However, typical ferrogels, especially those prepared from natural polysaccharides, have limitations concerning their mechanical properties and the fabrication method of complex structures owing to their rigid and brittle properties. In this study, 3D printable and stretchable ferrogel was designed and prepared to overcome these limitations. Hyaluronic acid (HA) derivatives such as hydrazide-modified HA (hHA) and oxidized HA (oHA) were used as the base materials for gel preparation. Self-healing oHA/hHA hydrogels were prepared by the addition of adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH). Self-healing ferrogels with 3D printability were prepared by adding superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) to oHA/hHA/ADH hydrogels, which improved the stretchability owing to the double network formation (2.1 times its original length). Various 3D constructs were fabricated by an extrusion-based printing method using ferrogel (structural integrity = 94.3 ± 1.5%). The potential to fabricate hydrogel/ferrogel hybrid constructs for tissue engineering was also investigated. This approach for developing customized 3D constructs using magnetic field-responsive and 3D printable hydrogel systems may find useful applications in tissue engineering approaches.","Colloids and surfaces.

Programmable living assembly of materials by bacterial adhesion.,"The field of engineered living materials aims to construct functional materials with desirable properties of natural living systems. A recent study demonstrated the programmed self-assembly of bacterial populations by engineered adhesion. Here we use this strategy to engineer self-healing living materials with versatile functions. Bacteria displaying outer membrane-anchored nanobody-antigen pairs are cultured separately and, when mixed, adhere to each other to enable processing into functional materials, which we term living assembled material by bacterial adhesion (LAMBA). LAMBA is programmable and can be functionalized with extracellular moieties up to 545 amino acids. Notably, the adhesion between nanobody-antigen pairs in LAMBA leads to fast recovery under stretching or bending. By exploiting this feature, we fabricated wearable LAMBA sensors that can detect bioelectrical or biomechanical signals.

Development of a self-healing soft pneumatic actuator: a first concept.,"Inspired by the intrinsic softness and the corresponding embodied intelligence principles, soft pneumatic actuators (SPA) have been developed, which ensure safe interaction in unstructured, unknown environments. Due to their intrinsic softness, these actuators have the ability to resist large mechanical impacts. However, the soft materials used in these structures are in general susceptible to damage caused by sharp objects found in the unstructured environments. This paper proposes to integrate a self-healing (SH-) mechanism in SPAs, such that cuts, tears and perforations in the actuator can be self-healed. Diels-Alder (DA-) polymers, covalent polymer network systems based on the thermoreversible DA-reaction, were selected and their mechanical, as well as SH-properties, are described. To evaluate the feasibility of developing an SPA constructed out of SH-material, a single cell prototype, a SH-soft pneumatic cell (SH-SPC), was constructed entirely out of DA-polymers. Exploiting the SH-property of the DA-polymers, a completely new shaping process is presented in this paper, referred to as 'shaping through folding and self-healing'. 3D polygon structures, like the cubic SH-SPC, can be constructed by folding SH-polymer sheet. The sides of the structures can be sealed and made airtight using a SH-procedure at relatively low temperatures (<90 °C). Both the (thermo) mechanical and SH-properties of the SH-SPC prototype were experimentally validated and showed excellent performances. Macroscopic incisions in the prototype were completely healed using a SH-procedure (<70 °C). Starting from this single-cell prototype, it is straight-forward to develop a multi-cell prototype, the first SPA ever built completely out of SH-polymers.",Bioinspiration & biomimetics,eng,2015,Jul
Finite Element Analysis of Self-Healing Concrete Beams Using Bacteria.,"Deterioration or crack formation in concrete elements is a phenomenon that cannot be easily avoided, and it has a high cost of repair. A modern technology that needs wider study is the use of the bio-precipitation of calcium carbonate using bacteria to increase a structures' capacity. The current research presents an analytical study on self-healing concrete beams using bacteria to enhance the beam's capacity. A Finite Element Analysis on (ANSYS 15.0) was carried out to study the effect of the bacteria concentration (the weight of bacteria to cement weight 1%, 2%, and 3%), the type of bacteria (<i>Bacillus subtilis, E. coli,</i> and <i>Pseudomonas sps.</i>), and the loading (a one-point load, a two-point load, and a distributed load on four points) on concrete beams. Two beams were chosen from previous experimental research and simulated on the ANSYS before carrying out our parametric study to verify the validity of our simulation. Following this, our parametric study was carried out on eight beams; each beam was loaded gradually up to failure. The results show that the optimum type of bacteria was the <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, and that the bacteria concentration of 3% for <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> can increase the beam's capacity by 20.2%. Also, we found that distributing the load to four points led to the increase of the beam's capacity by 74.5% more than the beam with a one-point load.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Oct

Self-healing and anti-freezing graphene-hydrogel-graphene sandwich strain sensor with ultrahigh sensitivity.,"Hydrogels with specially designed structures and adjustable properties have been considered as smart materials with multi-purpose application prospects, especially in the field of flexible sensors. However, most hydrogel-based sensors have low sensitivity, which inevitably affects their promotion in the market. Herein, a strain sensor comprising a poly(vinyl alcohol)/poly(acrylic acid) (PVA/PAA) hybrid hydrogel sandwiched between two graphene layers was successfully constructed in a facile way, and it exhibited many excellent properties including extremely high sensitivity. The incorporation of glycerol ensured the good flexibility and anti-freezing performance of the hydrogel-based sensor even at -15 °C.

In particular, the sandwich-structured hydrogel sensor showed a very high gauge factor (GF) value of 39 at the strain of 50%, which is much higher than those of most ordinary hydrogel-based strain sensors. A super stable signal value after 5000 strain cycles and a very short response time of 274 ms guaranteed the long-term usability and sensitivity of the hydrogel-based sandwich sensor.

Multifunctional Extracellular Matrix Hydrogel with Self-Healing Properties and Promoting Angiogenesis as an Immunoregulation Platform for Diabetic Wound Healing.,"Treating chronic wounds is a global challenge. In diabetes mellitus cases, long-time and excess inflammatory responses at the injury site may delay the healing of intractable wounds. Macrophage polarization (M1/M2 types) can be closely associated with inflammatory factor generation during wound healing. Quercetin (QCT) is an efficient agent against oxidation and fibrosis that promotes wound healing. It can also inhibit inflammatory responses by regulating M1-to-M2 macrophage polarization. However, its limited solubility, low bioavailability, and hydrophobicity are the main issues restricting its applicability in wound healing. The small intestinal submucosa (SIS) has also been widely studied for treating acute/chronic wounds. It is also being extensively researched as a suitable carrier for tissue regeneration. As an extracellular matrix, SIS can support angiogenesis, cell migration, and proliferation, offering growth factors involved in tissue formation signaling and assisting wound healing. We developed a series of promising biosafe novel diabetic wound repair hydrogel wound dressings with several effects, including self-healing properties, water absorption, and immunomodulatory effects. A full-thickness wound diabetic rat model was constructed for in vivo assessment of QCT@SIS hydrogel, in which hydrogels achieved a markedly increased wound repair rate. Their effect was determined by the promotion of the wound healing process, the thickness of granulation tissue, vascularization, and macrophage polarization during wound healing. At the same time, we injected the hydrogel subcutaneously into healthy rats to perform histological analyses of sections of the heart, spleen, liver, kidney, and lung. We then tested the biochemical index levels in serum to determine the biological safety of the QCT@SIS hydrogel. In this study, the developed SIS showed convergence of biological, mechanical, and wound-healing capabilities. Here, we focused on constructing a self-healing, water-absorbable, immunomodulatory, and biocompatible hydrogel as a synergistic treatment paradigm for diabetic wounds by gelling the SIS and loading QCT for slow drug release.","Gels (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2023,May

Detecting the activation of a self-healing mechanism in concrete by acoustic emission and digital image correlation.,"Autonomous crack healing in concrete is obtained when encapsulated healing agent is embedded into the material.

In this research, an experimental approach implementing an advanced optical and acoustic method sets up scopes to monitor and justify the crack formation and capsule breakage of concrete samples tested under three-point bending. Digital Image Correlation was used to visualize the crack opening. The optical information was the basis for an extensive and analytical study of the damage by Acoustic Emission analysis.

Here, inspired by the strong hydrogen bonding of glycerol and water, the chelation cross-linking between glycerol and borax, we constructed a compact three-dimensional dynamic cross-linked net formed of glycerol-water-borax. Under stress, dynamic interactions of glycerol-water-borax net act as sacrificial bond energy for effective dissipation, which enables the hydrogel to achieve high flexibility, stretchability, and injectability. More importantly,because of the presence of glycerol, the antifreeze and moisturizing properties of the gel are improved. The hydrogel also exhibited an ultrafast self-healing ability of only 15 s.

Construction and Hierarchical Self-Assembly of Multifunctional Coordination Cages with Triangular Metal-Metal-Bonded Units.,"Herein, a series of face-capped (Tr<sub>2</sub>M<sub>3</sub>)<sub>4</sub>L<sub>4</sub> (Tr = cycloheptatrienyl cationic ring; M = metal; L = organosulfur ligand) tetrahedral cages <b>1</b>-<b>3</b> functionalized with 12 appended crown ether moieties were designed and synthesized. The reversible binding of ammonium cations with peripheral crown ether moieties to adjust internal guest-binding was realized. Combination of a bisammonium linker and cage <b>3</b> led to the formation of a supramolecular gel <b>SPN1</b> via host-guest interactions between the crown ether moieties and ammonium salts. The obtained supramolecular gel exhibited multiple-stimuli responsiveness, injectability, and excellent self-healing properties and could be further developed to a <b>SPN1</b>-based drug delivery system.

A selected bacterial strain for the self-healing process in cementitious specimens without cell immobilization steps.,"The use of microorganisms capable of mediating the bioprecipitation process can be an important application in the self-healing processes of cement specimens. Thus, the present study identified and evaluated five Bacillus strains for potential application in the protocol of self-healing via bioprecipitation. Cell growth, enzyme production, and kinetic parameters conditions were evaluated during the fermentation process. Based on the analysis of 16S rDNA in conjunction with biochemical testing, results demonstrate that the strains are either Bacillus cereus or Bacillus thuringiensis. Strategically it was found that the addition of glycerol to fermentative medium was essential to increase the bacterial concentration (≈ 4.2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells mL<sup>-1</sup>) and production of the enzyme urease (≈ 3.623,2 U.mL<sup>-1</sup>). The addition of this medium after 40 days of fermentation promoted the self-healing of cracks and increased compressive strength in ≈ 14.2% of the cementitious specimens; therefore, increasing the sustainability and engineering properties of cement-based materials.",Bioprocess and biosystems engineering,eng,2021,Jan
"Autonomous Healable Elastomers with High Elongation, Stiffness, and Fatigue Resistance.","Although self-healing elastomers have been developed in a great breakthrough, it is still a challenge to develop one kind of material that can respond to the fracture instantly even though this characteristic plays an essential role in emergency circumstances. Herein, we adopt free radical polymerization to construct one polymer network equipped with two weak interactions (dipole-dipole interaction and hydrogen bonding). The elastomer we synthesized has a high self-healing efficiency (100%) and a very short healing time (3 min) in an air atmosphere, and it can also self-heal in seawater, showing an ideal healing efficiency of >80%. Additionally, on account of its high elongation (>1000%) and antifatigue capacity (no rupture after loading-unloading 2000 times), the elastomer can be utilized in a wide range of applications, including e-skin and soft robot fields.",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,eng,2023,Apr
Integrated Construction of a Long-Life Stretchable Zinc-Ion Capacitor.,"The major challenge in achieving high-performance stretchable zinc-ion energy-storage devices is the combination of stretchable dendrite-free zinc negative electrodes and sufficient bonding between components (current collector, electrode, separator, and package). Herein, based on a series of physicochemically tunable self-healing polyurethanes, an elastic current collector is prepared through a swelling-induced wrinkling method, and then a stretchable zinc negative electrode prepared through in situ confined electroplating. The elastic current collector has a nano-network structure with polyurethane encapsulation, and exhibits both geometric and intrinsic stretchability. The stretchable zinc negative electrode formed in situ has high electrochemical activity and exhibits an excellent cycle life under the protection of a Zn<sup>2+</sup> -permeable coating. Furthermore, fully polyurethane-based stretchable zinc-ion capacitors are assembled through in situ electrospinning and hot-pressing techniques. Due to the high stretchability of the components and the interfusion of the matrixes, the integrated device exhibits excellent deformability and desirable electrochemical stability. This work provides a systematic construction plan for stretchable zinc-ion energy-storage devices in three aspects: material synthesis, component preparation, and device assembly.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2023,Sep
Double-Network Luminescent Films Constructed Using Sulfur Quantum Dots and Lanthanide Complexes.,"Although UV light-switchable luminescent films are of importance for application in soft optical devices and anticounterfeiting labels, there are still challenges in developing such films integrated with outstanding luminescent property, high self-healing efficiency, and simultaneously excellent mechanical strength. Herein, double-network (DN) luminescent films are designed and constructed via an intermolecular hydrogen bond crosslinking strategy of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in sulfur quantum dots (S-QDs) and polyurethane (PU), where S-QDs (""stone"" one) play dual roles of acting both as a soft segment to crosslink another segment PU (""bird"" one) and also as the origin of a luminescence center (""bird"" two) in films. In addition, lanthanide(III) complexes (LnCs, Ln═Eu<sup>3+</sup>, Tb<sup>3+</sup>) are employed as another emission source to embed in the films and switch the emission colors of DN films from the multicolor (red-yellow-green) of LnCs to the blue color of S-QDs by changing the ultraviolet excitation wavelength from 254 to 365 nm. It is worth noting that the crosslinking network strategy can effectively prevent S-QDs and LnCs from aggregating or leaking and enable both luminescence centers to homogeneously distribute, resulting in luminescent DN films possessing extraordinary UV light-switchable luminescence, improved mechanical property, and excellent self-healing ability. This work presents a viable method for the design and fabrication of luminescent films with multifunctional applications in flexible robotics, wearable devices, and dual-luminescent anticounterfeiting materials.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Sep

Tough and Degradable Self-Healing Elastomer from Synergistic Soft-Hard Segments Design for Biomechano-Robust Artificial Skin.,"Increasing biomechanical applications of skin-inspired devices raise higher requirements for the skin-bionic robustness and environmental compatibility of elastomers. Here, a tough and degradable self-healing elastomer (TDSE) is developed by a synergistic soft-hard segments design. The polyester/polyether copolymer is introduced in soft segments to endow TDSE with flexibility and degradability. The two isomeric diamines are regulated in hard segments for elevating the toughness and fracture energy to 82.38 MJ/m<sup>3</sup> and 43299 J/m<sup>2</sup> and autonomous self-healing ability with 93% efficiency in 7 h for the TDSE. Employing TDSE and ionic liquid, a biomechano-robust artificial skin (BA-skin) is constructed with a stretch-insensitive mechanosensation capability during 50% cyclic stretching. The BA-skin has high biomechano-robustness to bear tear damage and good environmental compatibility with total decomposability in a lipase solution.

Programmable and Self-Healing Light-Driven Actuators through Synergetic Use of Water-Shaping and -Welding Methods.,"Shape programming is critical for the fabrication of a light-driven actuator with complex shape morphing, which demonstrates potential applications in remote-controlled light-driven soft robots. However, it remains a huge challenge to obtain light-driven actuators having advantages of complex shape morphing, self-healing function, and facile fabrication simultaneously. Here, we report a facile strategy to obtain programmable and self-healing light-driven actuators with complex shape morphing. Various initial shapes of actuators can be programmed by synergetic use of water-shaping and -welding methods, which provides unlimited opportunities for fabricating actuators with predesigned shapes and subsequently demonstrating complex shape morphing. A template transfer method is used to prepare a single-layer graphene oxide (GO) film with asymmetric surface structures, which acts as the basic actuator and has the self-healing function based on the hydrophilic property of GO. It shows bending morphing under near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation due to the photothermal effect and asymmetric morphology on the opposite surfaces. Four more types of actuators are programmed from the basic actuator through the water-shaping method, which exhibits bending, unbending, twisting, and untwisting, respectively, under NIR light illumination. In addition, an S-shape actuator and a flower-shape actuator are programmed from the basic actuators through the water-welding method. By simply turning over the S-shape actuator, it can perform a bidirectional crawling motion. Finally, two intricate bionic light-driven actuators (tendril-shape and octopus-shape) are constructed, which are unattainable from conventional fabrication methods of actuators. We believe that this study will unlock a new way to programmable, self-healing, and light-driven soft robots with tunable and complex shape morphing.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Dec
Responsive Colloidosomes with Triple Function for Anticorrosion.,"Strategies for corrosion protection are required to prolong the life span of metallic structures used by the construction, aerospace, and transport industries. Currently, there are no coatings that can provide at the same time information about the corrosion status of the coated metal and protect the metal against corrosive species and mechanical damage. Herein, triple-functional microcarriers with functions of corrosion sensing, self-healing, and corrosion inhibition are produced and embedded in coatings to prolong the lifetime of metals and enhance the anticorrosion performance of coatings. The microcarriers are prepared by creating Pickering droplets loaded with a corrosion inhibitor and a healing agent and stabilized by silica nanocapsules containing thymol blue as corrosion sensor. The microcarriers are then embedded in a water-based polymer matrix coated on metal substrates. When the coating or metal is mechanically damaged, the healing agent is released from the droplets to hinder further corrosion of the metal. When the local pH value near the metal surface is changing by the generation of hydroxide ion due to the corrosion process, a change of color is detected as well as a release of corrosion inhibitor, leading to a significant decrease of corrosion rate of the coated metal.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Sep
A NIR-II light-modulated injectable self-healing hydrogel for synergistic photothermal/chemodynamic/chemo-therapy of melanoma and wound healing promotion.,"The development of an injectable multifunctional hydrogel with tumor therapy, antibacterial treatment and wound healing properties is essential for simultaneously eradicating melanoma and promoting wound healing of tumor-initiated skin defects. Herein, iron ion-doped polyaniline (PANI(Fe)) tethered with guar gum (GG) chains is employed for the first time as a building unit for constructing a superior hydrogel (GG@PANI(Fe)-borax) crosslinked by borate/didiol bonds. Due to the dynamic and reversible properties of boronate ester bonds, the GG@PANI(Fe)-borax hydrogels had convenient injectability, rapid self-healing ability, and reversible gel-sol transformations under thermal- or pH-stimuli. More importantly, they took advantage of the second near-infrared (NIR-II) responsive photothermal conversion capability, accompanied by the photothermal-enhanced high cytotoxic ˙OH generation in the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-enriched tumor microenvironment induced by iron-doped PANI. The as-prepared hydrogels exhibited excellent photothermal effects and controllable NIR-triggered drug release, leading to distinctly synergistic photothermal/chemodynamic/chemo-therapy effects of melanoma both <i>in vitro</i> (98.2%) and <i>in vivo</i> (98.8%). In addition, the obtained hydrogels also exhibited good anti-bacterial activity (>97.1%) against both Gram-positive (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>) and Gram-negative (<i>Escherichia coli</i>) bacteria because they were based on PANI(Fe) and borax, which exhibit antibacterial activity. Furthermore, these GG@PANI(Fe)-incorporated scaffolds could improve fibroblast cell proliferation and angiogenesis for accelerating wound repair in tumor-bearing and infected wound mice. Taken together, GG@PANI(Fe)-borax hydrogels may be used simultaneously for eradication of skin-tumor cells, inhibiting infection and accelerating wound healing. This work offers an effective and facile strategy to fabricate an ""all-in-one"" multifunctional hydrogel platform for synergetic multimodal integrated therapy of tumors.",Journal of materials chemistry.

Interpretable Machine Learning for Prediction of Post-Fire Self-Healing of Concrete.,"Developing accurate and interpretable models to forecast concrete's self-healing behavior is of interest to material engineers, scientists, and civil engineering contractors. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence are powerful tools that allow constructing high-precision predictions, yet often considered ""black box"" methods due to their complexity. Those approaches are commonly used for the modeling of mechanical properties of concrete with exceptional accuracy; however, there are few studies dealing with the application of ML for the self-healing of cementitious materials. This paper proposes a pioneering study on the utilization of ML for predicting post-fire self-healing of concrete. A large database is constructed based on the literature studies. Twelve input variables are analyzed: w/c, age of concrete, amount of cement, fine aggregate, coarse aggregate, peak loading temperature, duration of peak loading temperature, cooling regime, duration of cooling, curing regime, duration of curing, and specimen volume. The output of the model is the compressive strength recovery, being one of the self-healing efficiency indicators. Four ML methods are optimized and compared based on their performance error: Support Vector Machines (SVM), Regression Trees (RT), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Ensemble of Regression Trees (ET). Monte Carlo analysis is conducted to verify the stability of the selected model. All ML approaches demonstrate satisfying precision, twice as good as linear regression. The ET model is found to be the most optimal with the highest prediction accuracy and sufficient robustness. Model interpretation is performed using Partial Dependence Plots and Individual Conditional Expectation Plots. Temperature, curing regime, and amounts of aggregates are identified as the most significant predictors.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2023,Feb
Alkaliphiles: The Emerging Biological Tools Enhancing Concrete Durability.,"Concrete is one of the most commonly used building materials ever used. Despite it is a very important and common construction material, concrete is very sensitive to crack formation and requires repair. A variety of chemical-based techniques and materials have been developed to repair concrete cracks. Although the use of these chemical-based repair systems are the best commercially available choices, there have also been concerns related to their use. These repair agents suffer from inefficiency and unsustainability. Most of the products are expensive and susceptible to degradation, exhibit poor bonding to the cracked concrete surfaces, and are characterized by different physical properties such as thermal expansion coefficients which are different to that of concrete. Moreover, many of these repair agents contain chemicals that pose environmental and health hazards. Thus, there has been interest in developing concrete crack repair agents that are efficient, long lasting, safe, and benign to the environment and exhibit physical properties which resemble that of the concrete. The search initiated by these desires brought the use of biomineralization processes as tools in mending concrete cracks. Among biomineralization processes, microbially initiated calcite precipitation has emerged as an interesting alternative to the existing chemical-based concrete crack repairing system. Indeed, results of several studies on the use of microbial-based concrete repair agents revealed the remarkable potential of this approach in the fight against concrete deterioration. In addition to repairing existing concrete cracks, microorganisms have also been considered to make protective surface coating (biodeposition) on concrete structures and in making self-healing concrete.Even though a wide variety of microorganisms can precipitate calcite, the nature of concrete determines their applicability. One of the important factors that determine the applicability of microbes in concrete is pH. Concrete is highly alkaline in nature, and hence the microbes envisioned for this application are alkaliphilic or alkali-tolerant. This work reviews the available information on applications of microbes in concrete: repairing existing cracks, biodeposition, and self-healing. Moreover, an effort is made to discuss biomineralization processes that are relevant to extend the durability of concrete structures.

Preparation of chitosan biguanidine/PANI-containing self-healing semi-conductive waterborne scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.,"Electrically conducting self-healing scaffolds are known as a new series of intelligent biomaterial for regulating Human Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cells biological behaviors, especially their differentiation to bone cells. Herein, we developed a novel hydrophilic semi-conductive chitosan derivative (CP) and loaded it into the self-healing waterborne polyurethane structure, as a new osteogenic agent. The fabricated scaffolds exhibited excellent shape memory properties with shape fixity (> 97 %) and shape recovery ratio (> 98 %) with excellent self-healing value (> 93 %) at a temperature close to the body temperature. The results of MTT, cell attachment, alkaline phosphatase activity, and alizarin red staining analysis demonstrated that the CP-contained scaffolds promote proliferation of hADSCs and matrix mineralization. Also, by introducing the CP the gene expression level of COL-1, ALP, RUNX2, and OCN were significantly enhanced, in line with matrix mineralization.

Structuring of Hydrogels across Multiple Length Scales for Biomedical Applications.,"The development of new materials for clinical use is limited by an onerous regulatory framework, which means that taking a completely new material into the clinic can make translation economically unfeasible. One way to get around this issue is to structure materials that are already approved by the regulator, such that they exhibit very distinct physical properties and can be used in a broader range of clinical applications. Here, the focus is on the structuring of soft materials at multiple length scales by modifying processing conditions. By applying shear to newly forming materials, it is possible to trigger molecular reorganization of polymer chains, such that they aggregate to form particles and ribbon-like structures. These structures then weakly interact at zero shear forming a solid-like material. The resulting self-healing network is of particular use for a range of different biomedical applications. How these materials are used to allow the delivery of therapeutic entities (cells and proteins) and as a support for additive layer manufacturing of larger-scale tissue constructs is discussed. This technology enables the development of a range of novel materials and structures for tissue augmentation and regeneration.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2018,Apr
Dendrite Growth and Performance of Self-Healing Composite Electrode IPMC Driven by Cu<sup>2</sup>.,"As a kind of flexible intelligent driving material, ionic polymer-metal composite (IPMC) has attracted the attention of researchers due to its advantages of lightweight, large deformation, and fast response. However, the reciprocating bending of IPMC causes cracks to appear on the surface metal electrode layer and reduces the water uptake (WUP). At the same time, the metal particles are extruded, resulting in an increase in resistivity, which affects the driving performance of the materials. Therefore, in this study, considering the preparation cost, Cu-Pt-IPMC using Pt and Cu as a composite electrode with the self-healing system was prepared by electroless plating and Cu<sup>2+</sup> was used as driving ions that can form a reversible circulation system with a copper electrode. The WUP, surface resistivity, and driving performance were tested and analyzed and the surface roughness was characterized by Matlab. The results show that the dendritic interface electrodes (DIEs) appear at the contact interface between the metal electrode and the film, which extend deeper and wider in the film with the increase in the cycles of autocatalytic platinum plating (ACP-Pt), and the output displacement and blocking force of 61.20 mm and 34.26 mN, respectively, have been achieved in the Cu-Pt-IPMC sample after three cycles of ACP-Pt. Based on these analyses, this study proves that the presence of Cu<sup>2+</sup> can repair the cracked electrode on the surface of IPMC and reduce the surface electrode resistance, improving the driving performance.",ACS omega,eng,2022,May

Noncovalent π-stacked robust topological organic framework.,"Organic frameworks (OFs) offer a novel strategy for assembling organic semiconductors into robust networks that facilitate transport, especially the covalent organic frameworks (COFs). However, poor electrical conductivity through covalent bonds and insolubility of COFs limit their practical applications in organic electronics. It is known that the two-dimensional intralayer π∙∙∙π transfer dominates transport in organic semiconductors. However, because of extremely labile inherent features of noncovalent π∙∙∙π interaction, direct construction of robust frameworks via noncovalent π∙∙∙π interaction is a difficult task. Toward this goal, we report a robust noncovalent π∙∙∙π interaction-stacked organic framework, namely πOF, consisting of a permanent three-dimensional porous structure that is held together by pure intralayer noncovalent π∙∙∙π interactions. The elaborate porous structure, with a 1.69-nm supramaximal micropore, is composed of fully conjugated rigid aromatic tetragonal-disphenoid-shaped molecules with four identical platforms. πOF shows excellent thermostability and high recyclability and exhibits self-healing properties by which the parent porosity is recovered upon solvent annealing at room temperature. Taking advantage of the long-range π∙∙∙π interaction, we demonstrate remarkable transport properties of πOF in an organic-field-effect transistor, and the mobility displays relative superiority over the traditional COFs. These promising results position πOF in a direction toward porous and yet conductive materials for high-performance organic electronics.",Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America,eng,2020,Aug
Recent advances of slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces with anti-corrosion.,"Metal materials are susceptible to the influence of environmental media, and chemical or electrochemical multiphase reactions occur on the metal surface, resulting in the corrosion of metal materials, which can directly damage the geometry and reduce the physical properties of metal materials. This corrosion damage can seriously affect the long-term use of metal materials in marine equipment and the aerospace industry, and other fields. Inspired by the special microstructure and slippery properties of natural nepenthes intine, researchers have prepared slippery liquid-infused porous surfaces (SLIPS) with a stable continuous lubricant layer by injecting low-surface-energy lubricants into a substrate with a micro/nano-porous structure. This surface has excellent hydrophobicity, low friction, non-adhesiveness, and self-healing properties. The broad application prospects of SLIPS in the fields of anti-corrosion, anti-icing, anti-bacteria, and anti-fouling have made it a hot research topic directing the study of biomimetic materials at present. However, SLIPS are susceptible to environmental shear forces, such as ocean flow or extraneous fluids, resulting in destruction of the porous structure and loss of surface lubricant, thereby depriving SLIPS of the ability to protect metals from corrosion. Therefore, it is important for metal corrosion protection to find ways to improve the stability and extend the service life of SLIPS. Over the last several years, research into and development of SLIPS have come a long way. Herein, a summary of available reports on SLIPS is given in terms of design principles and their performance characteristics, the construction of rough/porous substrate structures, the choice of low-surface-energy modifiers and lubricants, and lubricant infusion methods. Ways of constructing different substrate structures and the characteristics, advantages, and disadvantages of choosing various modifiers and lubricants to prepare the surface are compared. Finally, a comprehensive summary and outlook of SLIPS with anti-corrosion properties are provided. We are convinced that a comprehensive review of SLIPS will provide important guidance and strong reference for the design and preparation of green and economical SLIPS with anti-corrosion capabilities in the future.","Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",eng,2023,Feb
Amorphous Polyphosphate and Ca-Carbonate Nanoparticles Improve the Self-Healing Properties of both Technical and Medical Cements.,"Cement is used both as a construction material and for medical applications. Previously, it has been shown that the physiological polymer inorganic polyphosphate (polyP) is morphogenetically active in regeneration of skin, bone, and cartilage. The present study investigates the question if this polymer is also a suitable additive to improve the self-healing capacity not only of construction cement but also of inorganic bone void fillers. For the application in the cement, two different polyP-based amorphous nanoparticles (NP) are prepared, amorphous Ca-polyP NP and amorphous Ca-carbonate (ACC) NP. The particles are integrated into poly(methyl methacrylate) in a concentration ratio of 1:10. This material applied onto Portland cement blocks either by brush application or by blow spinning strongly accelerates the self-healing property of the cement after a 10 day incubation period. Most likely, this process depends on bacteria and their membrane-associated alkaline phosphatase, resulting in the formation of calcite from ACC. In a second approach, polyP is integrated into a calcium-silicate-based cement used in reconstitutive medicine. Subsequently, the cement becomes softer and more elastic. The data show that bioinspired polyP/ACC NP are suitable additives to improve the self-healing of construction cement and to biologize bone cement.",Biotechnology journal,eng,2020,Dec
"Intelligent, Biodegradable, and Self-Healing Hydrogels Utilizing DNA Quadruplexes.","A new class of hydrogels utilizing DNA (DNA quadruplex gel) has been constructed by directly and symmetrically coupling deoxynucleotide phosphoramidite monomers to the ends of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) in liquid phase, and using the resulting DNA-PEG-DNA triblock copolymers as macromonomers.

Self-healing hybrid nanocomposites consisting of bisphosphonated hyaluronan and calcium phosphate nanoparticles.,"Non-covalent interactions are often regarded as insufficient to construct macroscopic materials of substantial integrity and cohesion.

These nanocomposites display a capacity for self-healing as well as adhesiveness to mineral surfaces such as enamel and hydroxyapatite. Most importantly, these non-covalently cross-linked composites are surprisingly robust yet biodegradable upon extensive in vitro and in vivo testing and show bone interactive capacity evidenced by bone ingrowth into material remnants.

Design of Robust Self-Healing Silicone Elastomers Based on Multiple H-Bonding and Dynamic Covalent Bond.,"A room-temperature self-healing silicone elastomer was prepared based on the synergistic effect of multiple H-bonding and dynamic covalent bond. The multiple bonds constructed by inserting thiourea into the polyurea network can inhibit the crystallization of hard urea H-bonds segments and activate the diffusion movement of polymer chains. Dynamic imine endows materials with a strong connection for the fracture interface by imine metathesis. The effect of thiourea on urea H-bonds was confirmed by the Fourier transform infrared spectrum, which showed obvious changes of H-bond density according to peak revolution of C═O and N-H. Differential scanning calorimetry demonstrated the transition from the crystalline to amorphous state after the introduction of thiourea. Tensile tests and scratch-healing tests showed that this design method can improve the self-healing property without sacrificing the mechanical strength. Finally, the optimized self-healing process was analyzed from the perspectives of the contact process, the interpenetration diffusion of the polymer chain, and rebuilding of crosslinking points between the two interfaces, which would build an avenue for constructing a fast, self-healing, and tough material.",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,eng,2022,Jan
Visible light triggered controlled formation of rapidly self-healing hydrogels based on thiol-disulfide exchange.,"The properties of stimuli-responsive hydrogels can be tailored under various external stimuli, but it is difficult to realize the customized adjustment of hydrogel properties since the crosslinking degree in the gelation process is intractable. Here, a visible light triggered thiol-disulfide exchange reaction was applied for constructing disulfide-crosslinked hydrogels from P(EMA-SS-PEG), a poly(ethylene glycol) grafted poly(ethyl methacrylate) derivative with a disulfide linkage as the grafting point. This photochemical method provides mild gelation conditions to handily regulate the morphology, mechanical properties, swelling ratio, and degradation rate of hydrogels by simply varying the irradiation time. Based on this strategy, these disulfide-crosslinked hydrogel coatings showed rapid self-healing in 10 min under ambient conditions, which was dependent on the width of the scratch, temperature, and humidity. Notably, spraying water on these coatings could significantly accelerate the self-healing process of large scratches (360 μm) at room temperature with a self-healing time of 1 hour, enabling the practical application of hydrogel coatings in a natural environment.",Soft matter,eng,2022,Apr
"All-Polysaccharide, Self-Healing Injectable Hydrogels Based on Chitosan and Oxidized Hydroxypropyl Polysaccharides.","Polysaccharide-based hydrogels are attractive materials for biomedical applications for reasons that include their polyfunctionality, generally benign nature, and biodegradability. However, the use of polysaccharide-based hydrogels may be limited by toxicity arising from small-molecule crosslinkers, or may involve undesired chemical modification [Hennink, W. E.; et al. <i>Adv. Drug Delivery Rev.</i> 2012, 64, 223-236]. Here, we report a green, simple, efficient strategy for the preparation of polysaccharide-based, in situ forming hydrogels. The Edgar group reports in the accompanying manuscript that chemoselective oxidation of oligo(hydroxypropyl)-substituted polysaccharides introduces ketone groups at the termini of the side chains [Nichols, B. L. B.; et al]. Amine-containing moieties can condense with ketones to form imines. The imine linkage is dynamic in the presence of water, providing the potential for self-healing [Wei, Z.; et al. <i>Adv. Funct. Mater.</i> 2015, 25, 1352-1359], injectability [Wei, Z.; et al. <i>Adv. Funct. Mater.</i> 2015, 25, 1352-1359], and pH responsiveness [Yao, K.; et al. <i>J. Appl. Polym. Sci.</i> 1993, 48, 343-354]. In this work, we designed and prepared two different types of hydrogels, oxidized hydroxypropyl cellulose/chitosan (Ox-HPC-Chitosan) and oxidized hydroxypropyl dextran/chitosan (Ox-HPD-Chitosan), each cross-linked by imine bonds. The mechanical properties of these hydrogels were characterized by rheometry, revealing that hydrogel storage modulus could be tuned from 300 Pa to 13 kPa simply by controlling the degree of substitution (DS) of ketone groups. Rheological characterization also illustrated the rapid self-healing property of these all-polysaccharide hydrogels. Moreover, these hydrogels exhibited high swelling rates and facile injectability.

To mitigate these complications, long-lasting microbial self-healing cement is an alternative that is eco-friendly and also actively repairs cracks. The present paper describes the detailed experimental investigation on compressive strength of cement mortars, mixed with six alkaliphilic bacteria, isolated from subsurface mica mines of high alkalinity. The experiments showed that the addition of alkaliphilic isolates at different cell concentrations (10<sup>4</sup> and 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) enhanced the compressive strength of cement mortar, because the rapid growth of bacteria at high alkalinity precipitates calcite crystals that lead to filling of pores and densifying the concrete mix. Thus, Bacillus subtilis (SVUNM4) showed the highest compressive strength (28.61%) of cement mortar at 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml compared to those of other five alkaliphilic isolates (Brevibacillus sp., SVUNM15-22.1%; P. dendritiformis, SVUNM11-19.9%; B. methylotrophicus, SVUNM9-16%; B. licheniformis, SVUNM14-12.7% and S. maltophilia, SVUNM13-9.6%) and controlled cement mortar as well. This method resulted in the filling of cracks in concrete with calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), which was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our results showed that the alkaliphilic bacterial isolates used in the study are effective in self-healing and repair of concrete cracks.",Scientific reports,eng,2018,Apr
An UV-photo and ionic dual responsive interpenetrating network hydrogel with shape memory and self-healing properties.,"Shape memory hydrogels have attracted extensive attention in fields such as artificial tissues, biomimetic devices and diagnostics, and intelligent biosensors. However, the practical applications were hindered by the absence of self-healing capability and multi-stimuli-responsiveness. To address these issues, we developed a shape memory hydrogel with self-healing and dual stimuli-response performance. The hydrogel system was constructed <i>via</i> an interpenetrating network consisting of <i>in situ</i> radical polymerization and host-guest interaction. The hydrogel exhibited rapid self-healing property, which can be stretched after self-healing for 1 min at 25 °C. Besides, the hydrogel displayed varied swelling performance in different light or solvent conditions. Moreover, the hydrogel showed a dual stimuli-responsive shape memory effect to ultraviolet (UV) light and ionic strength in 1 min. Such a shape memory hydrogel with self-healing ability and multi-stimuli-responsive properties will offer an option toward intelligent soft materials for biomedical and bionic research.",RSC advances,eng,2022,May
A binary concrete crack self-healing system containing oxygen-releasing tablet and bacteria and its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-precipitation performance.,"A strategy to supply molecular oxygen for microbial calcium precipitation was developed for the first time. Firstly, a controlled oxygen-releasing tablet (ORT) containing CaO<sub>2</sub> and lactic acid with a suitable ratio of 9:1 was developed. It can provide a stable oxygen supply and maintain pH in the range of 9.5-11.0 for 45 days while contacting with water. In the presence of oxygen, a self-healing bacterium H4 spores germinated more effectively and maintained high metabolic activity. Furthermore, H4 vegetative cells induced 50 % more calcium precipitation than that obtained without oxygen supply. Finally, a binary self-healing system containing bacterial spores and ORT was established. The calcium precipitation experiments showed that H4 in the binary self-healing system precipitated 27.5 mM calcium with oxygen supply after 32 days and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration of the solution decreased from 15 to 4 mg l<sup>-1</sup>, while only 6.9 mM calcium precipitation was obtained without oxygen supply. This work can disclose the effect of oxygen on microbial calcium precipitation and further lay a foundation for the establishment of ternary self-healing system containing bacteria, ORT, and nutrients, which will be promising for the self-healing of cracks deep inside the concrete structure.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2016,Dec
Biodegradable Natural Rubber Based on Novel Double Dynamic Covalent Cross-Linking.,"In this paper, biodegradable epoxidized natural rubber containing cyclic carbonate groups (CNR) was prepared by the reaction between epoxidized natural rubber (ENR) and carbon dioxide. Dynamic disulfide bonds and a boronic ester structure were successfully constructed and then the cross-linking network was formed by the thermally initiated ""click"" reaction between thiol groups of the cross-linker and the residual epoxy groups of ENR. As a result of the exquisite double dynamic covalent structure, the material exhibits high self-healing efficiency. Moreover, by virtue of the cyclic carbonate structure of the CNR, the natural rubber was confirmed to be biodegradable according to the biodegradable measurement. To the best of our knowledge, natural rubber with biodegradable and self-healing characteristics was obtained for the first time.",Polymers,eng,2022,Mar
Polymerization-Driven Self-Wrinkling on a Frozen Hydrogel Surface toward Ultra-Stretchable Polypyrrole-Based Supercapacitors.,"The construction of ultra-stretchable and smart supercapacitors with a large deformation-tolerance range and highly efficient self-healability is fully desired for next-generation wearable electronics. Herein, a sandwich-structured self-wrinkling hydrogel film (SSHF) is fabricated by freezing-constrained polymerization-driven self-wrinkling. Polypyrrole layers are first polymerized on a frozen pre-stretching hydrogel surface and subsequently self-wrinkled upon releasing the pre-strain. The SSHF with two polypyrrole electrode layers sandwiched with a hydrogel electrolytic layer is finally achieved by cutting four edges, and the all-in-one integrated structure creatively avoids the delamination between the electrodes and the electrolyte. The as-obtained SSHF can be directly used as an integrated all-in-one supercapacitor demonstrating high specific capacitance (79.5 F g<sup>-1</sup> at 0.5 A g<sup>-1</sup>), large stretchability (>500%), and reliable room temperature self-healability. The freezing-constrained polymerization-driven self-wrinkling strategy might provide a unique self-wrinkling procedure to fabricate self-healable conducting polymer-based hydrogels for ultra-stretchable smart supercapacitors.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Oct
Alginate/polyacrylamide host-guest supramolecular hydrogels with enhanced adhesion.,"Although injectable hydrogels with minimally invasive delivery have garnered significant interest, their potential applications have been restricted by a singular property. In this study, a supramolecular hydrogel system with improved adhesion was constructed through host-guest interactions between alginate and polyacrylamide. The maximum tensile adhesion strength between the β-cyclodextrin and dopamine-grafted alginate/adamantane-grafted polyacrylamide (Alg-βCD-DA/PAAm-Ad, namely AβCDPA) hydrogels and pigskin reached 19.2 kPa, which was 76 % stronger than the non-catechol-based control hydrogel (β-cyclodextrin-grafted alginate/adamantane-grafted polyacrylamide, Alg-βCD/PAAm-Ad). Moreover, the hydrogels demonstrated excellent self-healing, shear-thinning, and injectable properties. The required pressure to extrude the AβCDPA<sub>2</sub> hydrogel from a 16G needle at a rate of 2.0 mL/min was 67.4 N. As the polymer concentration and adamantane substitution degree increased, the hydrogels exhibited higher modulus, stronger network structure, and lower swelling ratio and degradation rate. Encapsulating and culturing cells within these hydrogels demonstrated good cytocompatibility. Therefore, this hydrogel can serve as a viscosity extender or bioadhesive, and as a carrier material to deliver encapsulated therapeutic substances into the body through minimally invasive injection methods.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2023,Jul
Use of Methylcellulose-Based Pellet to Enhance the Bacterial Self-Healing of Cement Composite.,"In this study, a new type of bacterial carrier using methylcellulose was presented, and its applicability to self-healing concrete has been explored. Methylcellulose, the main component of a 2 mm pellet-shaped carrier, can remain stable in alkaline environments and expand in neutral or acidic environments. These properties allow bacteria to survive in the high-alkaline and high-pressure environments of early age concrete, and the number of bacteria increases rapidly in the event of cracks, accelerating crack closure. The results show that the survival rate of bacterial spores inside the mortar was increased, and the pellet provides an enhanced biological anchor suitable for bacterial activity, bacterial growth, and mineral precipitation. Further, the results indicate an improved self-healing efficiency compared with mixing bacteria directly into the cement composite.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Oct
Boronic Acid Esters and Anhydrates as Dynamic Cross-Links in Vitrimers.,"Growing environmental awareness imposes on polymer scientists the development of novel materials that show a longer lifetime and that can be easily recycled. These challenges were largely met by vitrimers, a new class of polymers that merges properties of thermoplastics and thermosets. This is achieved by the incorporation of dynamic covalent bonds into the polymer structure, which provides high stability at the service temperature, but enables the processing at elevated temperatures. Numerous types of dynamic covalent bonds have been utilized for the synthesis of vitrimers. Amongst them, boronic acid-based linkages, namely boronic acid esters and boroxines, are distinguished by their quick exchange kinetics and the possibility of easy application in various polymer systems, from commercial thermoplastics to low molecular weight thermosetting resins. This review covers the development of dynamic cross-links. This review is aimed at providing the state of the art in the utilization of boronic species for the synthesis of covalent adaptable networks. We mainly focus on the synthetic aspects of boronic linkages-based vitrimers construction. Finally, the challenges and future perspectives are provided.",Polymers,eng,2022,Feb
Self-Healing Originated van der Waals Homojunctions with Strong Interlayer Coupling for High-Performance Photodiodes.,"The dangling-bond-free surfaces of van der Waals (vdW) materials make it possible to build ultrathin junctions. Fundamentally, the interfacial phenomena and related optoelectronic properties of vdW junctions are modulated by the interlayer coupling effect. However, the weak interlayer coupling of vdW heterostructures limits the interlayer charge transfer efficiency, resulting in low photoresponsivity. Here, a bilayer MoS<sub>2</sub> homogeneous junction is constructed by stacking the as-grown onto the self-healed monolayer MoS<sub>2</sub>. The homojunction barrier of ∼165 meV is obtained by the electronic structure modulation of defect self-healing. This homojunction reveals the stronger interlayer coupling effect in comparison with vdW heterostructures. This ultrastrong interlayer coupling effect is experimentally verified by Raman spectra and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The ultrafast interlayer charge transfer takes place within ∼447 fs, which is faster than those of most vdW heterostructures. Furthermore, the homojunction photodiode manifests outstanding rectifying behavior with an ideal factor of ∼1.6, perfect air stability over 12 months, and high responsivity of ∼54.6 mA/W. Moreover, the interlayer exciton peak of ∼1.66 eV is found in vdW homojunctions. This work offers an uncommon vdW junction with strong interlayer coupling and perfects the relevance of interlayer coupling and interlayer charge transfer.",ACS nano,eng,2019,Mar
Performance of biological methods on self-healing and mechanical properties of concrete using S. pasteurii.,"Biological methods (adding bacteria to the concrete mixtures) among the most recently investigated procedures increase the durability of concrete and repair concrete cracks. In the present study, different biological methods were used to heal the cracks of concrete and the most suitable method was subsequently introduced as the main aim of the research. For this purpose, the culture medium, various sources of calcium salts as bacterial nutrients, and the effect of air-entrained agent on the healing process were studied. The results showed that the use of bacterial nutrient inside the concrete mixes has an affirmative impact on the mechanical properties and self-healing characteristics of concretes. Simultaneous use of Sporosarcina pasteurii bacteria and calcium nitrate-urea or calcium chloride-urea as a bacterial nutrient in the concrete mixture increased the 28 days compressive strength of concretes by 23.4% and 7.5%, respectively. The utilization of bacterial cells, nutrients, and culture in the concrete mixture provided the ability to heal wide cracks where the healing time was significantly reduced (about 8 days). On the other hand, separation of the bacterial culture medium slightly reduced the self-healing performance of the concretes.",Environmental science and pollution research international,eng,2023,Jan
Granular hydrogels: emergent properties of jammed hydrogel microparticles and their applications in tissue repair and regeneration.,"Granular hydrogels are emerging as a versatile and effective platform for tissue engineered constructs in regenerative medicine. The hydrogel microparticles (HMPs) that compose these materials exhibit particle jamming above a minimum packing fraction, which results in a bulk, yet dynamic, granular hydrogel scaffold. These injectable, microporous scaffolds possess self-assembling, shear-thinning, and self-healing properties. Recently, they have been utilized as cell cultures platforms and extracellular matrix mimics with remarkable success in promoting cellular infiltration and subsequent tissue remodeling in vivo. Furthermore, the modular nature of granular hydrogels accommodates heterogeneous HMP assembly, where varying HMPs have been fabricated to target distinct biological processes or deliver unique cargo.

Dynameric Collagen Self-Healing Membranes with High Mechanical Strength for Effective Cell Growth Applications.,"The fabrication of biocompatible adaptive materials with high stiffness and self-healing properties for medical applications is a challenging endeavor. Collagen is a major extracellular matrix component acting as a substrate for cell adhesion and migration. Dynamers are constitutional polymers whose monomeric components are linked through reversible bonds, able to modify their constitution through reversible exchange of their components. In the current work, we demonstrate that the rational combination of collagen and dynameric networks connected with reversible covalent imine bonds is a very important and previously unreported strategy to provide biocompatible membranes with self-healing ability and excellent mechanical strength. The key challenge in the construction of such membranes is the required adaptive interaction between collagen chains and the dynamic cross-linkers, preventing the formation of defects. For example, by varying structure and molecular lengths of the dynamers, the tensile strength of the dynameric membranes reach over 80 MPa, more than 400 % higher than that observed for the reference collagen membrane, and the highest value for break strain found, was 19 %. The self-healing properties were observed when reconnecting two membrane pieces or even from crushed status of the membranes. Moreover, both MTT assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy method demonstrated the good biocompatibility of the collagen membranes, leaving more than 90 % viability for NIH 3T3 cells after 24 h co-culture.","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",eng,2020,Dec

3D Printable Dynamic Hydrogel: As Simple as it Gets!,"3D printing technology offers a vast range of applications for tissue engineering applications. Over the past decade a vast range of new equipment has been developed; while, 3D printable biomaterials, especially hydrogels, are investigated to fit the printability requirements. The current candidates for bioprinting often require post-printing cross-linking to maintain their shape. On the other hand, dynamic hydrogels are considered as the most promising candidate for this application with their extrudability and self-healing properties. However, it proves to be very difficult to match the required rheological in a simple material. Here, this study presents for the first time the simplest formulation of a dynamic hydrogel based on thiol-functionalized hyaluronic acid formulated with gold ions that fulfill all the requirements to be printed without the use of external stimuli, as judged by the rheological studies. The printability is also demonstrated with a 3D printer allowing for the printing of the dynamic hydrogel as it is, achieving 3D construct with a relatively good precision and up to 24 layers, corresponding to 10 mm high. This material is the simplest 3D printable hydrogel and its mixture with cells and biological compounds is expected to open a new era in 3D bioprinting.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2022,Nov
"Rapid fabrication of bionic pyrogallol-based self-adhesive hydrogel with mechanically tunable, self-healing, antibacterial, wound healing, and hemostatic properties.","Hydrogels are functional materials that are similar to human skin and have received much attention in recent years for biomedical applications. However, the preparation of nontoxic, highly adhesive, and antimicrobial hydrogels in an efficient way remains a great challenge. Inspired by adhesive mussel foot proteins (mfps) which consist of abundant catecholic amino acids and lysine (Lys) residues, gallic acid-modified ε-poly-L-lysine (EPL/GA) was synthesized, and an active functional monomer (AA-EPL/GA) was then created through a reaction with acrylic acid (AA). The polymerization of AA-EPL/GA occurred rapidly (30-160 s) under blue light (λ = 405 nm) irradiation to produce a biomimetic PAA-EPL/GA hydrogel under mild conditions. The biomimetic pyrogallol-Lys distribution endowed the PAA-EPL/GA hydrogels with superior adhesion in humid environments (with an adhesive strength of 50.02 kPa toward wet porcine skin) and tunable mechanical and self-healing properties. Additionally, the PAA-EPL/GA hydrogels exhibited outstanding antibacterial ability due to the inherent characteristics of GA and EPL. In a mouse model, PAA-EPL/GA adhered firmly around the wound tissues. Photographs of the wound and the histological results demonstrated the ability of the hydrogel to promote wound healing, control wound infection, and suppress scar formation. Moreover, the hydrogel had a good hemostatic effect on liver bleeding. Our results highlighted the promising application potential of GA-based hydrogels, which were easily, harmlessly, and efficiently fabricated by blue light irradiation.",Biomaterials advances,eng,2022,May
Design of Self-Healing Supramolecular Rubbers by Introducing Ionic Cross-Links into Natural Rubber via a Controlled Vulcanization.,"Introducing ionic associations is one of the most effective approaches to realize a self-healing behavior for rubbers. However, most of commercial rubbers are nonpolar rubbers without now available functional groups to be converted into ionic groups. In this paper, our strategy was based on a controlled peroxide-induced vulcanization to generate massive ionic cross-links via polymerization of zinc dimethacrylate (ZDMA) in natural rubber (NR) and exploited it as a potential self-healable material. We controlled vulcanization process to retard the formation of covalent cross-link network, and successfully generated a reversible supramolecular network mainly constructed by ionic cross-links. Without the restriction of covalent cross-linkings, the NR chains in ionic supramolecular network had good flexibility and mobility. The nature that the ionic cross-links was easily reconstructed and rearranged facilitating the self-healing behavior, thereby enabling a fully cut sample to rejoin and retain to its original properties after a suitable self-healing process at ambient temperature. This study thus demonstrates a feasible approach to impart an ionic association induced self-healing function to commercial rubbers without ionic functional groups.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2016,Jul

Spatially controlled construction of assembloids using bioprinting.,"The biofabrication of three-dimensional (3D) tissues that recapitulate organ-specific architecture and function would benefit from temporal and spatial control of cell-cell interactions. Bioprinting, while potentially capable of achieving such control, is poorly suited to organoids with conserved cytoarchitectures that are susceptible to plastic deformation. Here, we develop a platform, termed Spatially Patterned Organoid Transfer (SPOT), consisting of an iron-oxide nanoparticle laden hydrogel and magnetized 3D printer to enable the controlled lifting, transport, and deposition of organoids. We identify cellulose nanofibers as both an ideal biomaterial for encasing organoids with magnetic nanoparticles and a shear-thinning, self-healing support hydrogel for maintaining the spatial positioning of organoids to facilitate the generation of assembloids. We leverage SPOT to create precisely arranged assembloids composed of human pluripotent stem cell-derived neural organoids and patient-derived glioma organoids. In doing so, we demonstrate the potential for the SPOT platform to construct assembloids which recapitulate key developmental processes and disease etiologies.",Nature communications,eng,2023,Jul
"Strong, Supertough and Self-Healing Biomimetic Layered Nanocomposites Enabled by Reversible Interfacial Polymer Chain Sliding.","Despite the remarkable progress in ultrastrong mechanical laminate materials, the simultaneous achievement of toughness, stretchability and self-healing properties in biomimetic layered nanocomposites remains a great challenge due to the intrinsic limitations of their hard essences and lack of effective stress transfer at the organic-inorganic fragile boundary. Here, an ultratough nanocomposite laminate is prepared by constructing chain-sliding cross-linking at the interface between sulfonated graphene nanosheets and polyurethane layers based on the ring molecules sliding on the linear polymer chains to release stresses. Unlike traditional supramolecular bonding toughening with limited sliding spacing, our strategy enables interfacial molecular chains reversible slippage when the inorganic nanosheets bear stretching force, providing sufficient interlayer spatial distance for relative sliding to dissipate more energy. The resulting laminates exhibit strong strength (22.33 MPa), supertoughness (219.08 MJ m<sup>-3</sup> ), ultrahigh stretchability (>1900 %) and self-healing ability (99.7 %), which far surpass most of reported synthetic and natural laminate materials. Moreover, the fabricated proof-of-concept electronic skin shows excellent flexibility, sensitivity and healability for human physiological signals monitoring. This strategy breaks through the challenge that traditional layered nanocomposites are intrinsically stiff and opens up the functional application of layered nanocomposites in flexible devices.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),eng,2023,Jun
Construction of durable superhydrophobic and anti-icing coatings <i>via</i> incorporating boroxine cross-linked silicone elastomers with good self-healability.,"The fragility of the micro-nano structure makes superhydrophobic coatings highly susceptible to stress, resulting in a decrease in their superhydrophobic and anti-icing performance. In this work, we proposed a new insight to improve durability by incorporating a thin layer of self-healable elastomer with a dynamic network on the micro-nano structure. We constructed superhydrophobic coatings (EP/SiO<sub>2</sub>/BFVSE) with a three-layered structure of the epoxy resin/silica nanoparticle/silicon elastomer. The silicon elastomer (BFVES) with a B-O dynamic cross-linked network and fluorinated moieties was synthesized by graft polymerization on vinyl silicon oil. The preparation route is facile and convenient for mass production. BFVES has rapid self-healing properties for scratches at room-temperature, underwater and at -18 °C. EP/SiO<sub>2</sub>/BFVSE preserved apparently higher CAs after being immersed in pH = 1, pH = 13, and NaCl solutions for 96 h as compared with the EP/SiO<sub>2</sub> coating. In a water striking environment, the CA of EP/SiO<sub>2</sub>/BFVSE was slightly decreased to 153°. SEM images further reveal that the recovery of superhydrophobicity and icephobicity is attributed to the self-healing behavior of the boroxine-containing silicon elastomer. The EP/SiO<sub>2</sub>/BFVSE coating also possesses additional self-healing ability under chemical oxidation. The high durability of the self-healable superhydrophobic coating enables great application potential in aircraft, marine vessels, and outdoor facilities in harsh environments.",Soft matter,eng,2022,Nov
Dynamic Colloidal Photonic Crystal Hydrogels with Self-Recovery and Injectability.,"Simulation of self-recovery and diversity of natural photonic crystal (PC) structures remain great challenges for artificial PC materials. Motivated by the dynamic characteristics of PC nanostructures, here, we present a new strategy for the design of hydrogel-based artificial PC materials with reversible interactions in the periodic nanostructures. The dynamic PC hydrogels, derived from self-assembled microgel colloidal crystals, were tactfully constructed by reversible crosslinking of adjacent microgels in the ordered structure via phenylboronate covalent chemistry. As proof of concept, three types of dynamic colloidal PC hydrogels with different structural colors were prepared. All the hydrogels showed perfect self-healing ability against physical damage. Moreover, dynamic crosslinking within the microgel crystals enabled shear-thinning injection of the PC hydrogels through a syringe (indicating injectability or printability), followed by rapid recovery of the structural colors. In short, in addition to the great significance in biomimicry of self-healing function of natural PC materials, our work provides a facile strategy for the construction of diversified artificial PC materials for different applications such as chem-/biosensing, counterfeit prevention, optical display, and energy conversion.","Research (Washington, D.C.)",eng,2021,No Data
Polymerizable Deep Eutectic Solvent-Based Skin-Like Elastomers with Dynamic Schemochrome and Self-Healing Ability.,"Animal skin is a huge source of inspiration when it comes to multifunctional sensing materials. Bioinspired sensors integrated with the intriguing performance of skin-like steady wide-range strain detection, real-time dynamic visual cues, and self-healing ability hold great promise for next-generation electronic skin materials. Here, inspired by the skins of a chameleon, cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) liquid crystal skeleton is embedded into polymerizable deep eutectic solvent (PDES) via in situ polymerization to develop a skin-like elastomer. Benefiting from the elastic ionic conductive PDES matrix and dynamic interfacial hydrogen bonding, this strategy has broken through the limitations that CNCs-based cholesteric structure is fragile and its helical pitch is non-adjustable, endowing the resulting elastomer with strain-induced wide-range (0-500%) dynamic structural colors and excellent self-healing ability (78.9-90.7%). Furthermore, the resulting materials exhibit high stretch-ability (1163.7%), strain-sensing and self-adhesive abilities, which make them well-suitable for developing widely applicable and highly reliable flexible sensors.

Self-Healing Coating with a Controllable Release of Corrosion Inhibitors by Using Multifunctional Zinc Oxide Quantum Dots as Valves.,"As an intelligent response system, self-healing anticorrosion materials containing nanocontainers have aroused increasing demands. It is highly expected that the nanocontainers can rapidly respond on corrosion signals to efficiently release corrosion inhibitors, meanwhile to avoid an undesirable leakage before the local corrosion happening. Herein, zinc oxide quantum dot (ZnO-QD)-sealed hollow mesoporous TiO<sub>2</sub> nanocontainers loading with 14.2% benzotriazole (BTA) inhibitor have been successfully prepared [hollow mesoporous titanium dioxide nanospheres (HMTNs)-BTA@ZnO-QDs]. ZnO-QDs play the multifunctional roles on anticorrosion of the self-healing coating. The corrosion tests of coatings on the carbon steel well demonstrate that ZnO-QDs can not only act as a valve to seal and release BTA on the time but also act as a precursor to produce the protective film of Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub> by the reaction of Zn<sup>2+</sup> ions with OH<sup>-</sup> around the cathode region to inhibit the corrosion of carbon steel. After being soaked in 3.5% NaCl solution for 30 days, the |<i>Z</i>|<sub>0.01 Hz</sub> value of the coating with HMTNs-BTA@ZnO-QDs still maintains at 2.87 × 10<sup>7</sup> Ω cm<sup>2</sup>. Once the defects are formed in the coating, the acid-responsive ZnO-QD valves are rapidly decomposed to release BTA inhibitor; meanwhile, the resulted Zn(OH)<sub>2</sub> layer prevent the carbon steel substrate from corrosion in the cathode area. Therefore, it could be promising that the present design of the nanocontainers matching with the multifunctional ZnO-QDs can offer a valuable strategy to construct the self-healing and anticorrosion coatings with a multiresponse to the corrosion environment.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Oct
Multifunctional Self-Healing Dual Network Hydrogels Constructed via Host-Guest Interaction and Dynamic Covalent Bond as Wearable Strain Sensors for Monitoring Human and Organ Motions.,"Hydrogel-based flexible strain sensors have shown great potential in body movement tracking, early disease diagnosis, noninvasive treatment, electronic skins, and soft robotics. The good self-healing, biocompatible, sensitive and stretchable properties are the focus of hydrogel-based flexible strain sensors. Dual network (DN) hydrogels are hopeful to fabricate self-healing hydrogels with the above properties. Here, multifunctional DN hydrogels are prepared via a combination of host-guest interaction of β-cyclodextrin and ferrocene with dynamic borate ester bonds of poly(vinyl alcohol) and borax.

Hierarchical Assemblies of Supramolecular Coordination Complexes.,"Hierarchical self-assembly (HAS) is a multilevel organization process that first assembles elementary molecular units into ordered secondary structures via noncovalent interactions, which further act as the building blocks to form more complex multifunctional superstructures at the next level(s). The HAS strategy has been used as a versatile method for the preparation of soft-matter nanoarchitectures of defined size and morphologies, tunable luminescence, and biological importance. However, such preparation can be greatly simplified if well-defined dynamic structures are employed as the cores that upon linking form the desired nanoarchitectures. Discrete supramolecular coordination complexes (SCCs) with well-defined shapes, sizes, and internal cavities have been widely employed to construct hierarchical systems with functional diversity. This Account summarizes the prevailing strategies used in recent years in the preparation of SCC-based HASs and illustrates how the combination of dynamic metal-ligand coordination with other interactions was used to obtain hierarchical systems with interesting properties. HASs with dual orthogonal interactions involving coordination-driven self-assembly and hydrogen bonding/host-guest interaction generally result in robust and flexible supramolecular gels. Likewise, hybridization of SCCs with a suitable dynamic covalent network via a hierarchical strategy is useful to prepare materials with self-healing properties. The intrinsic positive charges of the SCCs also make them suitable precursors for the construction of HASs via electrostatic interactions with negatively charged biological/abiological molecules. Furthermore, the interplay between the hydrophilic and lipophilic characters of HASs by varying the number and spacial orientation of alkyl/oxyethylene chains of the SCC is a simple yet controllable approach to prepare ordered and tunable nanostructures. Certain SCC-cored hierarchical systems exhibit reversible polymorphism, typically between micellar, nanofiber, and vesicular phases, in response to various external perturbations: heat, photoirradiation, pH-variance, redox-active agents, etc. At the same time, multiple noncovalent interaction mediated HASs are growing in numbers and are promising candidates for obtaining functionally diverse materials. The photophysical properties of SCC-based HASs have been used in many analytical applications. For example, embedding tetraphenylethene (TPE)-based pyridyl ligands within metallo-supramolecular structures partially restricts the molecular rotations of its phenyl rings, endowing the resultant SCCs with weak emissions. Further aggregation of such HASs in suitable solvents results in a marked enhancement in emission intensity along with quantum yields. They act as sensitive sensors for different analytes, including pathogens, drugs, etc. HASs are also useful to develop multidrug systems with cooperative chemotherapeutic effects. Hence, the use of HASs with theranostic SCCs combining cell-imaging agents and chemotherapeutic scaffolds is a promising drug delivery strategy for cancer theranostics. At the same time, their responsiveness to stimuli, oftentimes due to the dynamic nature of the metal-ligand interactions, play an important role in drug release via a disassembly mechanism.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2018,Sep
Mechanical properties of bio self-healing concrete containing immobilized bacteria with iron oxide nanoparticles.,"Concrete is arguably one of the most important and widely used materials in the world, responsible for the majority of the industrial revolution due to its unique properties. However, it is susceptible to cracking under internal and external stresses. The generated cracks result in a significant reduction in the concrete lifespan and an increase in maintenance and repair costs. In recent years, the implementation of bacterial-based healing agent in the concrete matrix has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to address the concrete cracking issue. However, the bacterial cells need to be protected from the high pH content of concrete as well as the exerted shear forces during preparation and hardening stages. To address these issues, we propose the magnetic immobilization of bacteria with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs). In the present study, the effect of the designed bio-agent on mechanical properties of concrete (compressive strength and drying shrinkage) is investigated. The results indicate that the addition of immobilized Bacillus species with IONs in concrete matrix contributes to increasing the compressive strength. Moreover, the precipitates in the bio-concrete specimen were characterized using scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). The characterization studies confirm that the precipitated crystals in bio-concrete specimen were CaCO<sub>3</sub>, while no precipitation was observed in the control sample.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2018,May
A silk fibroin based bioadhesive with synergistic photothermal-reinforced antibacterial activity.,"Bioadhesives have gained considerable popularity for application in wound closure. However, applying bioadhesives incurs risks associated with bacterial infection during wound healing. Hence, in this study, a silk fibroin based bioadhesive was constructed via employing natural macromolecule, silk fibroin (SF), to spontaneously coassemble with natural plant polyphenol, tannic acid (TA), and iron oxide nanoparticles (Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs). In the system, the natural macromolecule SF plays a key role in fabricating the macromolecular network matrix due to the change of the secondary structure of SF (from random coil to β-sheet) under the trigger of TA. Importantly, the strong hydrogen bonding interactions between SF and TA, and the coordination bonds between TA and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs endow the bioadhesive with high extensibility, self-healing properties, and considerable wet adhesion. Meanwhile, the synergy between the inherent photothermal properties of Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> NPs and TA/Fe<sup>3+</sup> complexes under near-infrared (NIR) radiation enables the bioadhesive superior photothermal-reinforced antibacterial activity. The multifunctional natural macromolecule bioadhesive is a potential candidate in clinical wound management for improved outcomes, especially in infected wounds.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2022,Jun
Polymer Binders Constructed through Dynamic Noncovalent Bonds for High-Capacity Silicon-Based Anodes.,"Silicon (Si) is a promising candidate for high-capacity anode materials owing to its high theoretical capacity (3579 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> ), low working voltage, and wide natural abundance, although its huge volume variation during charge/discharge processes always results in a short cycling life. Polymer binders play a vital role in improving the cycling performance of Si-based anodes, although traditional polyvinylidene difluoride cannot fulfil the requirements owing to its weak van der Waals forces with the Si surface. Recently, polymer binders constructed by dynamic bonds have been developed, which are reported to allow high-energy-density electrodes with improved electrochemical performance. With dynamic bonds including hydrogen bonding, ionic bonding, and host-guest interactions, these polymer binders possess self-healing capabilities and enhanced mechanical performance, achieving a tremendous advance in addressing the capacity fading of Si-based anodes. In this review, we will summarize the research progress of polymer binders constructed with dynamic bonds, and the challenges for their real applications in advanced Li-ion batteries will also be discussed.","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",eng,2019,Aug
Cephalopods-Inspired Rapid Self-Healing Nanoclay Composite Coatings with Oxygen Barrier and Super-Bubble-Phobic Properties.,"Polymeric coatings with oxygen barrier properties are an important technology in food packaging that can extend the shelf life of food products and reduce waste. Although a typical technology in practical use is the deposition of metal or inorganic materials between multilayer films to reduce the oxygen transmission rate, once the film is damaged, oxygen permeates through the damaged area, damaging the packaged food. In addition, nanobrick wall structures consisting of nanoplatelet bricks have the potential to replace barrier films made of inorganic materials; however, they similarly lack repair performance or have slow repair speed despite having repair performance. Inspired by the rapid self-repair mechanism of cephalopods, the study develops a nanoclay-containing coating that can rapidly repair surface damage via water within 10 s. By introducing CaCl<sub>2</sub>-derived counterions and montmorillonite for nanobrick wall structures into polyelectrolyte multilayers stacked by layer-by-layer self-assembly, the noncovalent polymer network is increased, resulting in mimicking a strong cephalopod-derived β-sheet structure and noncovalent intermolecular interactions derived from cephalopods. The high water retention at the surface showed super-bubble-phobicity in water and inhibited gas permeation. The oxygen permeability of the coatings with more than a certain amount of montmorillonite was less than 1/100 of that of bare polyethylene. The ultrafast self-healing gas barrier coating has the potential to be used not only for food products but also for electronics and pharmaceutical packaging and gas separation applications. The key technology developed in this study provides novel insights into the construction of self-healing membranes made of composite materials and will contribute to the formation of a sustainable society.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Aug
Transparent Conductive Supramolecular Hydrogels with Stimuli-Responsive Properties for On-Demand Dissolvable Diabetic Foot Wound Dressings.,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) remain a very considerable health care burden, and their treatment is difficult. Hydrogel-based wound dressings are appealing to provide an optimal environment for wound repair. However, the currently available hydrogel dressings still need surgical or mechanical debridement from the wound, causing reinjury of the newly formed tissues, wound infection, delayed healing time, and personal suffering. Additionally, to meet people's increasing demand, hydrogel wound dressings with improved performance and multifunctionality are urgently required. Here, a new multifunctional supramolecular hydrogel for on-demand dissolvable diabetic foot wound dressings is designed and constructed. Based on multihydrogen bonds between hydrophilic polymers, the resultant supramolecular hydrogels present controlled and excellent properties, such as good transparency, antibacterial ability, conductive, and self-healing properties. Thus, the supramolecular hydrogels improve the new tissue formation and provide a significant therapeutic effect on DFU by inducing angiogenesis, enhancing collagen deposition, preventing bacterial infection, and controlling wound infection. Remarkably, the resultant hydrogels also exhibit stimuli-responsive ability, which renders its capability to be dissolved on-demand, allowing for a facile DFU dressing removal. This multifunctional supramolecular hydrogel may provide a novel concept in the design of on-demand dissolvable wound dressings.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2020,Dec
Robust Photothermal Coating Strategy for Efficient Ice Removal.,"Preventing ice formation and ice swift removal from the solid surface are essential in numerous application fields. Superhydrophobic coating is an effective way to delay the icing phenomenon. However, the superhydrophobic coating was wetted easily after icing-deicing cycles that led to the failure of anti-icing. In this study, a robust, amphiphobic coating consisted of fluorinated multiwalled carbon nanotubes (FMWCNTs) and commercial polyurethane was constructed by a simply spray process. Because of the addition of FMWCNTs, the coating demonstrated a good amphiphobic feature and highly efficient photothermal conversion, which endowed the coating surface with excellent deicing and defrosting characteristics under sunlight irradiation. In addition, self-cleaning and self-healing properties of the coating under sunlight ensured its efficient photothermal conversion and long service life. To further improve the photothermal deicing effect, a coating system containing a photothermal layer (P), thermal-conductive layer (C), and thermal-protective layer (P) was constructed. The heat generating from the photothermal layer can transfer the whole coating surface by the conductive layer, but with limited transmission to substrate materials by a thermal-protective layer. The coating system can still deice and defrost rapidly on the whole surface and only a small portion of photothermal coating was irradiated under extremely low temperature. The outdoor experiment has confirmed that the coating melted and removed snow rapidly in a winter environment. The multifunctional photothermal deicing coating may have a wide application in outdoor surrounding.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Oct
"pH/NIR-responsive and self-healing coatings with bacteria killing, osteogenesis, and angiogenesis performances on magnesium alloy.","Although biodegradable polymer coatings can impede corrosion of magnesium (Mg)-based orthopedic implants, they are prone to excessive degradation and accidental scratching in practice. Bone implant-related infection and limited osteointegration are other factors that adversely impact clinical application of Mg-based biomedical implants. Herein, a self-healing polymeric coating is constructed on the Mg alloy together with incorporation of a stimuli-responsive drug delivery nanoplatform by a spin-spray layer-by-layer (SSLbL) assembly technique. The nanocontainers are based on simvastatin (SIM)-encapsulated hollow mesoporous silica nanoparticles (S@HMSs) modified with polydopamine (PDA) and polycaprolactone diacrylate (PCL-DA) bilayer. Owing to the dynamic reversible reactions, the hybrid coating shows a fast, stable, and cyclical water-enabled self-healing capacity. The antibacterial assay indicates good bacteria-killing properties under near infrared (NIR) irradiation due to synergistic effects of hyperthermia, reactive oxygens species (ROS), and SIM leaching. In vitro results demonstrate that NIR laser irradiation promotes the cytocompatibility, osteogenesis, and angiogenesis. The coating facilitates alkaline phosphatase activity and expedites extracellular matrix mineralization as well as expression of osteogenesis-related genes. This study reveals a useful strategy to develop multifunctional coatings on bioabsorbable Mg alloys for orthopedic implants.",Biomaterials,eng,2023,Oct
Hierarchical biomaterials via photopatterning-enhanced direct ink writing.,"Recent advances in additive manufacturing (AM) technologies provide tools to fabricate biological structures with complex three-dimensional (3D) organization. Deposition-based approaches have been exploited to manufacture multimaterial constructs. Stimulus-triggered approaches have been used to fabricate scaffolds with high resolution. Both features are useful to produce biomaterials that mimic the hierarchical organization of human tissues. Recently, multitechnology biofabrication approaches have been introduced that integrate benefits from different AM techniques to enable more complex materials design. However, few methods allow for tunable properties at both micro- and macro-scale in materials that are conducive for cell growth. To improve the organization of biofabricated constructs, we integrated direct ink writing (DIW) with digital light processing (DLP) to form multimaterial constructs with improved spatial control over final scaffold mechanics. Polymer-nanoparticle hydrogels were combined with methacryloyl gelatin (GelMA) to engineer dual inks that were compatible with both DIW and DLP. The shear-thinning and self-healing properties of the dual inks enabled extrusion-based 3D printing. The inclusion of GelMA provided a handle for spatiotemporal control of cross-linking with DLP. Exploiting this technique, complex multimaterial constructs were printed with defined mechanical reinforcement. In addition, the multitechnology approach was used to print live cells for biofabrication applications. Overall, the combination of DIW and DLP is a simple and efficient strategy to fabricate hierarchical biomaterials with user-defined control over material properties at both micro- and macro-scale.",Biofabrication,eng,2021,Sep
Self-Healable and Super-Tough Double-Network Hydrogel Fibers from Dynamic Acylhydrazone Bonding and Supramolecular Interactions.,"Macroscopic hydrogel fibers are highly desirable for smart textiles, but the fabrication of self-healable and super-tough covalent/physical double-network hydrogels is rarely reported. Herein, copolymers containing ketone groups were synthesized and prepared into a dynamic covalent hydrogel via acylhydrazone chemistry. Double-network hydrogels were constructed via the dynamic covalent crosslinking of copolymers and the supramolecular interactions of iota-carrageenan. Tensile tests on double-network and parental hydrogels revealed the successful construction of strong and tough hydrogels. The double-network hydrogel precursor was wet spun to obtain macroscopic fibers with controlled drawing ratios. The resultant fibers reached a high strength of 1.35 MPa or a large toughness of 1.22 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>. Highly efficient self-healing performances were observed in hydrogel fibers and their bulk specimens. Through the simultaneous healing of covalent and supramolecular networks under acidic and heated conditions, fibers achieved rapid and near-complete healing with 96% efficiency. Such self-healable and super-tough hydrogel fibers were applied as shape memory fibers for repetitive actuating in response to water, indicating their potential in intelligent fabrics.","Gels (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Feb
Molecular dynamics simulation insight into topological structure dependence of self-healing polymer nanocomposites.,"Polymer nanocomposites (PNCs), which exhibit excellent mechanical properties through the incorporation of fillers into polymers, have been extensively studied to achieve enhanced self-healing capability for their next-generation development. However, there is still a lack of investigation into the influence of the topological structures of nanoparticles (NPs) on the self-healing capability of PNCs. In this study, we utilized coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations (CGMDs) to construct a series of PNC systems composed of NPs with different topological structures, including Linear, Ring, and Cross topologies. We employed non-bonding interaction potentials to examine the interactions between the polymer and NPs, and varied the parameters to simulate different functional groups. Our results indicate that the stress-strain curves and the rate of performance loss validate that the Linear structure is the optimal topology for mechanical reinforcement and self-healing properties. By analyzing the stress heat map during stretching, we observed that the Linear structure NPs experience significant stress, allowing the matrix chains to dominate in small recoverable deformations during stretching. It can be speculated that NPs oriented in the direction of extrusion are more effective than others in enhancing performance. Overall, this work provides valuable theoretical guidance and a novel strategy for designing and manipulating high-performance, self-healing PNCs.",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,eng,2023,Jul
"pH Stimuli-Responsive, Rapidly Self-healable Coatings Enhanced the Corrosion Resistance and Osteogenic Differentiation of Mg-1Ca Osteoimplant.","Mg-Ca alloys have emerged as a promising research direction for biomedical implants in the orthopedic field. However, their clinical use is deterred by their fast corrosion rate. In this work, a pH stimuli-responsive silk-halloysite (HNT)/phytic acid (PA) self-healing coating (Silk-HNT/PA) is constructed to slow down the corrosion rate of Mg-1Ca alloy and its cell viability and osteogenic differentiation ability are enhanced. The Silk-HNT/PA coating exhibits appealing active corrosion protection, by eliciting pH-triggerable self-healing effects, while simultaneously affording superior biocompatibility and osteogenic differentiation ability. Moreover, in vivo studies by histological analysis also demonstrate better osseointegration for the Silk-HNT/PA coated Mg-1Ca alloy. In summary, the Silk-HNT/PA coating in the present study has great potential in enhancing the biomedical utility of Mg alloys.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",eng,2022,Sep
Screening of Fungi for Potential Application of Self-Healing Concrete.,"Concrete is susceptible to cracking owing to drying shrinkage, freeze-thaw cycles, delayed ettringite formation, reinforcement corrosion, creep and fatigue, etc. Continuous inspection and maintenance of concrete infrastructure require onerous labor and high costs. If the damaging cracks can heal by themselves without any human interference or intervention, that could be of great attraction. In this study, a novel self-healing approach is investigated, in which fungi are applied to heal cracks in concrete by promoting calcium carbonate precipitation. The goal of this investigation is to discover the most appropriate species of fungi for the application of biogenic crack repair. Our results showed that, despite the significant pH increase owing to the leaching of calcium hydroxide from concrete, Aspergillus nidulans (MAD1445), a pH regulatory mutant, could grow on concrete plates and promote calcium carbonate precipitation.",Scientific reports,eng,2019,Feb
Stretchable and Self-Healing Integrated All-Gel-State Supercapacitors Enabled by a Notch-Insensitive Supramolecular Hydrogel Electrolyte.,"Next-generation wearable electronics are expected to endure significant deformations and mechanical damage. Therefore, self-healing stretchable electrolytes with high ionic conductivity and robust mechanical strength, which have high tolerance of deformations and spontaneously recover electrochemical properties after external damage, are necessary conditions for the realization of flexible supercapacitors. Here, a new type of zwitterionic supramolecular hydrogel cross-linked through rationally designed ionic associations and hydrogen bonds is reported (PAD/H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). The resultant supramolecular network realizes a high ionic conductivity of 57 mS cm<sup>-1</sup> and unprecedented mechanical properties such as a high toughness of 35 000 J m<sup>-2</sup>, a notch-insensitive of up to 2200% strain, and efficient instantaneous self-healing within 5 min. Acting as an electrolyte, a novel flexible supercapacitor design strategy is proposed by integrating capacitive materials directly onto the PAD/H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> hydrogel to achieve exceptional electrochemical performance, which can be repeatable for at least 50 cutting/healing cycles. The facile and versatile strategy for the construction of the integrated all-gel-state supercapacitors with self-healing stretchable electrolytes will provide new directions for future long-life flexible devices.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2018,Oct
Tris -N-Nitrilotriacetic Acid Fluorophore as a Self-Healing Dye for Single-Molecule Fluorescence Imaging.,"The photostability of fluorescent labels comprises one of the main limitations in single-molecule fluorescence (SMF) and super-resolution imaging. An attractive strategy to increase the photostability of organic fluorophores relies on their coupling to photostabilizers, e.g., triplet excited state quenchers, rendering self-healing dyes. Herein we report the self-healing properties of trisNTA-Alexa647 fluorophores (NTA, N-nitrilotriacetic acid). Primarily designed to specifically label biomolecules containing an oligohistidine tag, we hypothesized that the increased effective concentration of Ni(II) triplet state quenchers would lead to their improved photostability. We evaluated photon output, survival time, and photon count rate of different Alexa647-labeled trisNTA constructs differing in the length and rigidity of the fluorophore- trisNTA linker. Maximum photon output enhancements of 25-fold versus Alexa647-DNA were recorded for a short tetraproline linker, superseding the solution based photostabilization by Ni(II). Steady-state and time-resolved studies illustrate that trisNTA self-healing role is associated with a dynamic excited triplet state quenching by Ni(II). Here improved photophysical/photochemical properties require for a judicious choice of linker length and rigidity, and in turn a balance between rapid dynamic triplet excited state quenching versus dynamic/static singlet excited state quenching. TrisNTA fluorophores offer superior properties for SMF allowing specific labeling and increased photostability, making them ideal candidates for extended single-molecule imaging techniques.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,eng,2018,Sep
Photoregulating of Stretchability and Toughness of a Self-Healable Polymer Hydrogel.,"Supramolecular hydrogels that are assembled through dynamic host-guest interactions have presented apparent potential in the construction of materials with promising performance. Herein, a photoregulated hydrogel cross-linked by host-guest interactions with multifunctions of high stretchability, strong toughness, and rapid self-healing property is reported. The hydrogel exhibits unique light-responsive property due to the introduction of two photoisomerized groups. For example, the stress-strain curve of the original hydrogel indicates 1020% rupture strain with the maximum tensile strain value of 214 kPa. Upon 365 nm light irradiation for an hour, its tensile strain increases to 15 times with lower tensile stress indicating a better stretchability. Moreover, the hydrogel is photochromic and surface patternable, where it can reversibly switch color between luminous yellow and brown while exposed to 365 and 440 nm light irradiation. It holds great promise for applying in self-recovering optically controlled and labeled elastic mechanical materials.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2018,May
"Degradable Hydrogel Adhesives with Enhanced Tissue Adhesion, Superior Self-Healing, Cytocompatibility, and Antibacterial Property.","Degradable hydrogel adhesives with multifunctional advantages are promising to be candidates as hemostatic agents, surgical sutures, and wound dressings. In this study, hydrogel adhesives are constructed by catechol-conjugated gelatin from natural resource, iron ions (Fe<sup>3+</sup> ), and a synthetic polymer. Specifically, the latter is prepared by the radical ring-opening copolymerization of a cyclic ketene acetal monomer 5,6-benzo-2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane and N-(2-ethyl p-toluenesulfonate) maleimide. By the incorporation of ester bonds in the backbone and the combination with quaternary ammonium salt pendants in the polymer, it exhibits excellent degradability and antibacterial property. Remarkably, doping the synthetic polymer into the 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid-modified gelatin network forms a semi-interpenetrating polymer network which can effectively improve the rigidity, tissue adhesion, and antibacterial property of fabricated hydrogel adhesives. Moreover, non-covalent bonds from coordination interaction between catechol and Fe<sup>3+</sup> contribute to the fast self-healing of the developed hydrogel adhesives. These hydrogel adhesives with the multiple merits including the degradability, enhanced tissue adhesion, superior self-healing, good cytocompatibility, and antibacterial property show the great potential to be used as tissue adhesives in biomedical fields.",Advanced healthcare materials,eng,2022,Feb
Addressing the need for standardization of test methods for self-healing concrete: an inter-laboratory study on concrete with macrocapsules.,"Development and commercialization of self-healing concrete is hampered due to a lack of standardized test methods. Six inter-laboratory testing programs are being executed by the EU COST action SARCOS, each focusing on test methods for a specific self-healing technique. This paper reports on the comparison of tests for mortar and concrete specimens with polyurethane encapsulated in glass macrocapsules. First, the pre-cracking method was analysed: mortar specimens were cracked in a three-point bending test followed by an active crack width control technique to restrain the crack width up to a predefined value, while the concrete specimens were cracked in a three-point bending setup with a displacement-controlled loading system. Microscopic measurements showed that with the application of the active control technique almost all crack widths were within a narrow predefined range. Conversely, for the concrete specimens the variation on the crack width was higher. After pre-cracking, the self-healing effect was characterized via durability tests: the mortar specimens were tested in a water permeability test and the spread of the healing agent on the crack surfaces was determined, while the concrete specimens were subjected to two capillary water absorption tests, executed with a different type of waterproofing applied on the zone around the crack. The quality of the waterproofing was found to be important, as different results were obtained in each absorption test. For the permeability test, 4 out of 6 labs obtained a comparable flow rate for the reference specimens, yet all 6 labs obtained comparable sealing efficiencies, highlighting the potential for further standardization.",Science and technology of advanced materials,eng,2020,Sep
<i>In Situ</i> Biomimetic Mineralization of Bone-Like Hydroxyapatite in Hydrogel for the Acceleration of Bone Regeneration.,"A critical-sized bone defect, which cannot be repaired through self-healing, is a major challenge in clinical therapeutics. The combination of biomimetic hydrogels and nano-hydroxyapatite (nano-HAP) is a promising way to solve this problem by constructing an osteogenic microenvironment. However, it is challenging to generate nano-HAP with a similar morphology and structure to that of natural bone, which limits the improvement of bone regeneration hydrogels. Inspired by our previous works on organic-inorganic cocross-linking, here, we built a strong organic-inorganic interaction by cross-linking periosteum-decellularized extracellular matrix and calcium phosphate oligomers, which ensured the <i>in situ</i> mineralization of bone-like nano-HAP in hydrogels. The resulting biomimetic osteogenic hydrogel (BOH) promotes bone mineralization, construction of immune microenvironment, and angiogenesis improvement <i>in vitro</i>. The BOH exhibited acceleration of osteogenesis <i>in vivo</i>, achieving large-sized bone defect regeneration and remodeling within 8 weeks, which is superior to many previously reported hydrogels. This study demonstrates the important role of bone-like nano-HAP in osteogenesis, which deepens the understanding of the design of biomaterials for hard tissue repair.

Tunable Microgel-Templated Porogel (MTP) Bioink for 3D Bioprinting Applications.,"Micropores are essential for tissue engineering to ensure adequate mass transportation for embedded cells. Despite the considerable progress made by advanced 3D bioprinting technologies, it remains challenging to engineer micropores of 100 µm or smaller in cell-laden constructs. Here, a microgel-templated porogel (MTP) bioink platform is reported to introduce controlled microporosity in 3D bioprinted hydrogels in the presence of living cells. Templated gelatin microgels are fabricated with varied sizes (≈10, ≈45, and ≈100 µm) and mixed with photo-crosslinkable formulations to make composite MTP bioinks. The addition of microgels significantly enhances the shear-thinning and self-healing viscoelastic properties and thus the printability of bioinks with cell densities up to 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> mL<sup>-1</sup> in matrix. Consistent printability is achieved for a series of MTP bioinks based on different component ratios and matrix materials. After photo-crosslinking the matrix phase, the templated microgels dissociated and diffused under physiological conditions, resulting in corresponding micropores in situ. When embedding osteoblast-like cells in the matrix phase, the MTP bioinks support higher metabolic activity and more uniform mineral formation than bulk gel controls. The approach provides a facile strategy to engineer precise micropores in 3D printed structures to compensate for the limited resolution of current bioprinting approaches.",Advanced healthcare materials,eng,2022,Apr
Optimisation of self-healing of bio-foamed concrete bricks pores using Bacillus tequilensis under different temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> curing conditions.,"The self-healing of bio-concrete cracks and pores have been utilised worldwide to improve the properties of bio-concrete using different types of bacteria. Meanwhile, no published research was conducted to heal bio-foamed concrete bricks (B-FCB) pores using Bacillus tequilensis. Previous studies focused on the concentration of bacteria and neglect other factors that could affect the healing process. This research aimed to optimise the healing ratio of B-FCB pores using four factors: B. tequilensis concentration, concrete density, temperature and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration. Initial water absorption (IWA) and water absorption (WA) were used as responses in statistical methods, namely, factorial and response surface methodology (RSM). B. tequilensis species was isolated from cement kiln dust, produced in a powder form, then subjected to simulate test using a special medium consisting of foamed concrete materials to check the survival ability in B-FCB. SEM, EDX, and XRD were used to investigate the healing process of B-FCB pores. The results revealed that the decrement ratios of IWA and WA of B-FCB were 52.8% and 29.1% compared to FCB, respectively. SEM results reflect the healing that occurred in B-FCB pores, mostly healed via precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub> as demonstrated on the XRD results.",Scientific reports,eng,2022,Feb
Polyvinyl Alcohol-Stabilized Liquid Metal Hydrogel for Wearable Transient Epidermal Sensors.,"Wearable epidermal sensors are attracting growing interests in human activity monitoring and flexible touch display, but they are still limited by the poor self-healing property and the difficult dissolvable feature. Herein, we report polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-stabilized liquid metal particles (LMPs) (PVA-LMPs) hydrogels with excellent self-healing performance and the dissolvable feature for wearable epidermal sensors, constructed by dispersing LMPs of eutectic gallium and indium into the borate-modified PVA polymer networks. Interestingly, the PVA-LMPs hydrogels exhibited excellent electrically and mechanically self-healing ability. Moreover, the PVA-LMPs hydrogel can be fabricated as epidermal sensors, which can accurately monitor the human activities. Additionally, the epidermal sensors are dissolvable, showing an attractive feature for on demand transient electronics. It is demonstrated that the hydroxyl groups of PVA can stabilize LMPs via hydrogen-bonding interactions. Furthermore, the dynamic cross-linking bonds between hydrogels and LMPs can rupture and coalesce reversibly in the hydrogel network, which endow the hydrogels with both electrically and mechanically self-healing ability.

Dual Cross-Linked Biofunctional and Self-Healing Networks to Generate User-Defined Modular Gradient Hydrogel Constructs.,"Gradient hydrogels have been developed to mimic the spatiotemporal differences of multiple gradient cues in tissues. Current approaches used to generate such hydrogels are restricted to a single gradient shape and distribution. Here, a hydrogel is designed that includes two chemical cross-linking networks, biofunctional, and self-healing networks, enabling the customizable formation of modular gradient hydrogel construct with various gradient distributions and flexible shapes. The biofunctional networks are formed via Michael addition between the acrylates of oxidized acrylated hyaluronic acid (OAHA) and the dithiol of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-sensitive cross-linker and RGD peptides. The self-healing networks are formed via dynamic Schiff base reaction between N-carboxyethyl chitosan (CEC) and OAHA, which drives the modular gradient units to self-heal into an integral modular gradient hydrogel. The CEC-OAHA-MMP hydrogel exhibits excellent flowability at 37 °C under shear stress, enabling its injection to generate gradient distributions and shapes. Furthermore, encapsulated sarcoma cells respond to the gradient cues of RGD peptides and MMP-sensitive cross-linkers in the hydrogel. With these superior properties, the dual cross-linked CEC-OAHA-MMP hydrogel holds significant potential for generating customizable gradient hydrogel constructs, to study and guide cellular responses to their microenvironment such as in tumor mimicking, tissue engineering, and stem cell differentiation and morphogenesis.",Advanced healthcare materials,eng,2017,Aug
"Phase-locked constructing dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomers with superior toughness, autonomous self-healing and recyclability.","Stretchable ionic conductors are considerable to be the most attractive candidate for next-generation flexible ionotronic devices. Nevertheless, high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties, good self-healing capacity and recyclability are necessary but can be rarely satisfied in one material. Herein, we propose an ionic conductor design, dynamic supramolecular ionic conductive elastomers (DSICE), via phase-locked strategy, wherein locking soft phase polyether backbone conducts lithium-ion (Li<sup>+</sup>) transport and the combination of dynamic disulfide metathesis and stronger supramolecular quadruple hydrogen bonds in the hard domains contributes to the self-healing capacity and mechanical versatility. The dual-phase design performs its own functions and the conflict among ionic conductivity, self-healing capability, and mechanical compatibility can be thus defeated. The well-designed DSICE exhibits high ionic conductivity (3.77 × 10<sup>-3</sup> S m<sup>-1</sup> at 30 °C), high transparency (92.3%), superior stretchability (2615.17% elongation), strength (27.83 MPa) and toughness (164.36 MJ m<sup>-3</sup>), excellent self-healing capability (~99% at room temperature) and favorable recyclability.

Herein, we report on surface-energy-driven self-healing energetic linear polyurethane elastomers (EPU) that were facilely fabricated by two-step methods to acquire high healing efficiency and mechanical properties. By constructing surface energy and dynamic hard domains, energetic linear polyurethane elastomers not only obtained high healing ability and mechanical properties at high or room temperature but also avoid the use of some assisted healing conditions and complex chemical structure design and decrease manufacturing difficulty. Based on the interfacial healing physical model, various trends of surface tension, radius, and depth of the crack bottom were calculated to analyze the healing mechanism. We propose that polyurethane elastomers with low junction density could generate excess surface energy resulting from damage and drive self-healing, and incorporating a small amount of disulfide bonds increases the slightly packed hard phase and decreases the healing energy barrier. This work may offer a novel strategy for improving mechanical tensile and healing ability in the field of self-healing material application.",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,eng,2021,Aug
3D-printable self-healing and mechanically reinforced hydrogels with host-guest non-covalent interactions integrated into covalently linked networks.,"Natural polymer hydrogels are one of the best biomaterials for soft tissue repair because of their excellent biocompatibility, biodegradability and low immune rejection. However, they lack mechanical strength matching that of natural tissue and desired functionality (e.g. self-healing and 3D-printability). To solve this problem, we developed a host-guest supramolecule (HGSM) with three arms covalently crosslinked with a natural polymer to construct a novel hydrogel with non-covalent bonds integrated in a covalently crosslinked network. The unique structure enabled the hydrogel to bear improved mechanical properties and show both self-healing and 3D printing capabilities. The three-armed HGSM was first prepared via the efficient non-covalent host-guest inclusion interactions between isocyanatoethyl acrylate-modified β-cyclodextrin (β-CD-AOI<sub>2</sub>) and acryloylated tetra-ethylene glycol-modified adamantane (A-TEG-Ad). Subsequently, a host-guest supramolecular hydrogel (HGGelMA) was obtained through copolymerization between the arms of HGSM and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) to form a covalently crosslinked network. The HGGelMA was robust, fatigue resistant, reproducible and rapidly self-healing. In HGGelMA, the covalent crosslinking maintained its overall shape whereas the weak reversible non-covalent host-guest interactions reinforced its mechanical properties and enabled it to rapidly self-heal upon fracturing. The reversible non-covalent interactions could be re-established upon breaking, so as to heal the hydrogel and dissipate energy to prevent catastrophic fracture propagation. Furthermore, the precursors of the HGGelMA were sufficiently viscous and could be rapidly photocrosslinked to produce a robust scaffold with an exquisite internal structure through 3D printing. The 3D-printed HGGelMA hydrogel scaffold was biocompatible, promoted cell adhesion and proliferation, and supported tissue in-growth. Our strategy of integrating non-covalently linked HGSM in a covalently linked hydrogel network represents a new approach to the development of natural polymers into biocompatible hydrogels with improved strength as well as desired self-healing and 3D-printability.",Materials horizons,eng,2019,May
A Stretchable and Self-Healing Energy Storage Device Based on Mechanically and Electrically Restorative Liquid-Metal Particles and Carboxylated Polyurethane Composites.,"Stretchable and self-healing (SH) energy storage devices are indispensable elements in energy-autonomous electronic skin. However, the current collectors are not self-healable nor intrinsically stretchable, they mostly rely on strain-accommodating structures that require complex processing, are often limited in stretchability, and suffer from low device packing density and fragility. Here, an SH conductor comprising nickel flakes, eutectic gallium indium particles (EGaInPs), and carboxylated polyurethane (CPU) is presented. An energy storage device is constructed by the two SH electrodes assembled with graphene nanoplatelets sandwiching an ionic-liquid electrolyte. An excellent electrochemical healability (94% capacity retention upon restretching at 100% after healing from bifurcation) is unveiled, stemming from the complexation modulated redox behavior of EGaIn in the presence of the ligand bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide, which enhances the reversible Faradaic reaction of Ga. Self-healing can be achieved where the damaged regions are electrically restored by the flow of liquid metal and mechanically healing activated by the interfacial hydrogen bonding of CPU with an efficiency of 97.5% can be achieved. The SH conductor has an initial conductivity of 2479 S cm<sup>-1</sup> that attains a high stretchability with 700% strain, it restores 100% stretchability even after breaking/healing with the electrical healing efficiency of 75%.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2019,Jan
Effect of Counterions on the Physicomechanical Properties of Copper-Nitrogen-Coordinated Metallosupramolecular Elastomers.,"Metallosupramolecular elastomers have attracted much attention due to their excellent mechanical properties, flexible tailoring of performance, and responsiveness to photo and thermal stimuli. The physicomechanical properties of metallosupramolecular elastomers are highly dependent on metal salts and ligand units; however, the role of counterions lacks practical exploration. To this end, we synthesized a simple acrylate copolymer model and introduced copper salts with different counterions to construct dynamic copper-nitrogen coordination cross-linked networks. This approach generated a series of elastomers with a tensile strength of over 10 MPa and a laser self-healing efficiency of over 90% within 2 min. In particular, we studied the effects of counterions on the thermodynamic, viscoelastic, mechanical, photothermal, and self-healing properties of the materials. Therefore, this work can provide instruction for the preparation and performance tailoring of metallosupramolecular elastomers.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Dec
Self-healing gels triggered by ultrasound with color-tunable emission based on ion recognition.,"Herein, O-substituted terpyridine motif was used as both rigid fluorescent π core and ion binding site, in order to construct an novel amphiphilic organogelator TEC containing cholesterol unit. We demonstrated a ultrasound induced reversible sol-gel transition approach driven by adjusted non covalent interactions and the resulted gels showed self-healing properties and tunable emission color when incorporating inorganic ions into the gel matrices. By heating-cooling process, the gel transformed to sol again. Simultaneously, the vesicle-tube morphology transition controlled by sonication and heating-cooling was also observed, together with aggregation induced emission enhancement (AIE) property of the gel. The results suggested that ultrasound promoted the J aggregations of terpyridine motifs and enhanced the hydrogen bonding interactions of TEC molecules, leading to the gelation process.",Journal of colloid and interface science,eng,2019,Mar
Autogenous Healing in Cementitious Materials with Superabsorbent Polymers Quantified by Means of NMR.,"A recent advance in construction technology is the use of self-healing cementitious materials containing synthetic microfibers and superabsorbent polymers. By stimulating autogenous healing by means of superabsorbent polymers, cracks are closed and this will cause an increase in durability and service life. However, this improved healing capacity has not been quantified yet in terms of increased further hydration and volume of healing products. This is needed to model the material and to stimulate the practical application in constructions. This paper provides quantitative data, obtained by an NMR study. Addition of 1 m% of selected superabsorbent polymer versus cement to a cementitious material, stimulated further hydration with nearly 40% in comparison with a traditional cementitious material, if 1 h water contact per day was allowed. At 90% relative humidity, no healing was observed in reference samples. While the further hydration around a crack in specimens with superabsorbent polymers was still 68% of that of a reference system with cyclic water contact, due to the uptake of moisture by the superabsorbent polymers. As such, NMR results quantify the positive influence of superabsorbent polymers in terms of stimulated autogenous healing and substantiate their benefits for application in the construction area.",Scientific reports,eng,2020,Jan
Facile strategy to construct a self-healing and biocompatible cellulose nanocomposite hydrogel via reversible acylhydrazone.,"Facile strategy to construct a cellulose nanocomposite hydrogel with self-healing and biocompatible properties is reported by crosslinking dialdehyde cellulose nanocrystals with acylhydrazine-terminated polyethylene glycol via dynamic reversible acylhydrazone for the first time. The effects of process variables on gelation time, mechanical strength and self-healing efficiency of hydrogels were investigated. It was found that gelation time shortened from hours to seconds by adjusting gelator and catalyst concentration. Tensile and compressive strength of hydrogel could reach 141 K Pa and 580 K Pa at 20.1% gelator concentration, respectively. Interestingly, the as-prepared hydrogel presented excellent self-healing ability without additional stimuli whose healing efficiency was higher than 90% even at higher gelator concentration. Furthermore, Cytotoxicity test showed that cell viability almost reached 100% after culturing with hydrogel, which revealed the hydrogel was biocompatible.",Carbohydrate polymers,eng,2019,Aug
"Self-Healable, Highly Stretchable, Ionic Conducting Polymers as Efficient Protecting Layers for Stable Lithium-Metal Electrodes.","Although numerous studies on polymeric protective films to stabilize lithium (Li)-metal electrodes have been reported, the construction of self-healing polymers that enables the long-term operation of Li-metal batteries (LMBs) at relatively low temperatures has rarely been demonstrated. Herein, a highly stretchable, autonomous self-healable, and ionic-conducting polymer network (SHIPN) is synthesized as an efficient protective film for LMBs. The network backbone, synthesized from copolymerization of poly(ethylene glycol)-mono-methacrylate (PEGMMA) and 2-[[(butylamino)carbonyl]oxy]ethyl acrylate (BCOE), is chemically cross-linked via diisocyanate. With SHIPN-modified electrodes, enhanced electrochemical performance can be achieved in Li/Cu, Li/Li, and Li/LiFePO<sub>4</sub> (Li/LFP) cells. The SHIPN@Li/LFP cell delivers a capacity retention of 85.6% after 500 cycles at 5 °C, resulting from the low-temperature self-healability of SHIPN. In full cells with a high-mass-loading LFP cathode (∼17 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>), the capacity retention is at least 300% higher than that with a bare Li electrode. Further physical characterizations of electrodes confirm the effect of SHIPN in enhancing the interfacial stability and suppressing Li dendrite growth. Our results will provide insights into rationally designing soft and hybrid materials toward stable LMBs at different temperatures.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Jun
Injectable self-healing hydrogels formed via thiol/disulfide exchange of thiol functionalized F127 and dithiolane modified PEG.,"Injectable self-healing hydrogels have found broad applications in drug delivery, tissue engineering and controlled 3D cell culture. Recently, cyclic disulfides were found to be useful in cross-linking and stabilizing liposomes by disulfide exchange polymerization, benefiting from the enhanced reactivity of the disulfide bonds. Herein, we report an injectable self-healing hydrogel constructed from cross-linked F127 with thermo and pH dual responsivity. The rapid sol-gel transition ability at body temperature allows it to be used as an injectable hydrogel. And the increased reactivity of the disulfides of cyclic dithiolane due to the ring tension makes the hydrogel self-heal under not only alkaline conditions but also neutral or even mildly acidic conditions.",Journal of materials chemistry.

Protein-Inspired Self-Healable Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXenes/Rubber-Based Supramolecular Elastomer for Intelligent Sensing.,"Progress toward the integration of electronic sensors with a signal processing system is important for artificial intelligent and smart robotics. It demands mechanically robust, highly sensitive, and self-healable sensing materials which could generate discernible electric variations responding to external stimuli. Here, inspired by the supramolecular interactions of amino acid residues in proteins, we report a self-healable nanostructured Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>MXenes/rubber-based supramolecular elastomer (NMSE) for intelligent sensing. MXene nanoflakes modified with serine through an esterification reaction assemble with an elastomer matrix, constructing delicate dynamic supramolecular hydrogen bonding interfaces. NMSE features desirable recovered toughness (12.34 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>) and excellent self-healing performance (∼100%) at room temperature. The NMSE-based sensor with high gauge factor (107.43), low strain detection limit (0.1%), and fast responding time (50 ms) can precisely detect subtle human motions (including speech, facial expression, pulse, and heartbeat) and moisture variations even after cut/healing processes. Moreover, NMSE-based sensors integrated with a complete signal process system show great feasibility for speech-controlled motions, which demonstrates promising potential in future wearable electronics and soft intelligent robotics.",ACS nano,eng,2020,Mar
Optimization of bacterial sporulation using economic nutrient for self-healing concrete.,"The use of heat- and alkali-resistant bacteria is essential for the biological repair of damaged concrete. Lysinibacillus boronitolerans YS11 was isolated from the rhizosphere of Miscanthus sacchariflorus. The increased pH in the urea-minus condition during the growth of the YS11 strain promoted calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) formation. To identify the optimum medium that promoted the growth of the YS11 strain, a Plackett-Burman design was conducted for the screening process. Consequently, malt powder, rice bran, (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and corn syrup were chosen to enhance YS11 growth. The optimization of these four useful factors was carried out using a central composite design. To obtain higher survivability in mortar, the sporulation process is essential, and additional factors such as Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> were found to contribute to sporulation. A mixture of L. boronitolerans YS11 spore powder, cement, paste, sand, yeast extract, calcium lactate, and water showed a healing effect on a 0.3 mm mortar crack in 7 days. Furthermore, calcium carbonate precipitation was observed over the crack surface. Thus, we confirmed that mortar treated with YS11 spore powder was effective in healing micro-cracks in concrete.","Journal of microbiology (Seoul, Korea)",eng,2020,Apr
Macroscopic Self-Assembly of Gel-Based Microfibers toward Functional Nonwoven Fabrics.,"Macroscopic self-assembly has increasingly attracted numerous concerns because of the facile fabrication of complex structures and diversified morphologies. Key challenges still remain to design high-performance building blocks to increase the efficiency and diversity of macroscopic self-assembly. Here, we designed triple noncovalent interactions (carboxyl-Zn<sup>2+</sup> coordination, host-guest interactions, and hydrogen bonding interactions) to enhance the interactions between self-healing fibers, constructing multidimensional nonwoven fiber-based fabrics through macroscopic self-assembly without further postprocessing. Profiled from the strong interactions generated from triple noncovalent interactions, ordered two-dimensional plane and three-dimensional spiral gel fabrics were fabricated using polyvinyl pyrrolidone/gel-based fibers as building blocks toward a human motion sensor. Moreover, we demonstrated that the macroscopic self-assembly strategy is universal to construct three-dimensional film-based fabrics toward wound dressing based on the triple noncovalent interactions between two-dimensional films. This macroscopic self-assembly approach provides an alternative strategy to fabricate gel fabrics for various applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Nov
Cyclodextrins and Cyclodextrin Derivatives as Green Char Promoters in Flame Retardants Formulations for Polymeric Materials. A Review.,"Polymers are intrinsically flammable materials; hence, fire retardance (FR) is required in their most common applications (i.e., electronic and construction, to mention some). Recently, it has been reported that cyclodextrin (CD) and cyclodextrin derivatives are beginning to be introduced into Intumescent Fire Retardant (IFR) formulations in place of pentaerythritol, which is used in IFRs that are currently on the market. Since IFRs are of less environmental concern than their hazardous halogen containing counterparts, the use of natural origin compounds in IFRs provides a way to comply with green chemistry issues. BCD and BCD derivatives presence in IFR mixtures promotes a higher yield of blowing gases and char when polymeric materials undergo combustion. Both processes play important roles in intumescence. The key rule to obtain in insulating compact char is the good dispersion of the nanoparticles in the matrix, which can be achieved by functionalizing nanoparticles with BCD derivatives. Moreover, CD derivatives are attractive because of their nanosized structure and their ability to form inclusion complexes with many compounds used as FR components, reducing their release to the environment during their shelf life of FR items. Often, fire retardance performed by BCD and BCD derivatives accompanies other relevant properties, such as improved mechanical resistance, washability resistance, self healing ability, thermal conductivity, etc. The application of CD fire retardant additives in many polymers, such as poly(lactic acid), poly(propylene), poly(vinyl acetate), poly(methyl methacrylate), linear low density poly(ethylene), polyamides, and polyesters are comprehensively reviewed here.",Polymers,eng,2019,Apr
Dual crosslinking hydrogels with tunable injectability and stability for bone repair.,"As an ideal biomaterial, the injectable dual crosslinking hydrogel can fill irregular shaped defects for treating bone defects. Despite advances in the fabrication of injectable dual crosslinking hydrogels, current methods pose several limitations in the gelation process, such as unadjustable injectability, materials loss after injection and the employment of nonphysiological environments. A more rational designed hydrogel should be shear-thinning and self-healing quickly after injection, which requires a reversible noncovalent or dynamic covalent interaction. Besides, the improved mechanical properties and stability can be achieved <i>in vivo</i>. In this present research study, inspired by a high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in the bone defect sites, a strategy combining hydrogen bonds and ion coordination to construct dual crosslinking hydrogels is developed. The prefabricated gel precursors based on hydrogen bonds of synthetic triblock poly(aspartic acid)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(aspartic acid) copolymers and tannic acid can be injected smoothly and recover rapidly to the initial state after injection. In addition, the hydrogel network can be crosslinked more tightly through the -COOH-Ca<sup>2+</sup> chelation, which results in reinforced mechanical properties and stability. The developed injectable dual crosslinking hydrogels will provide a design idea for the secondary crosslinking of injectable hydrogels <i>in vivo</i>, especially in the bone repair sites.",Journal of materials chemistry.

"Self-healing, ultra-stretchable, and highly sensitive conductive hydrogel reinforced by sulfate polysaccharide from Enteromorpha prolifera for human motion sensing.","The synthesis of multifunctional conductive hydrogel has attracted extensive attention worldwide due to their integrated properties of stretchability, self-adhesion, self-healing, and high sensitivity, while it is still a challenge. Although various kinds of polysaccharides and their derivatives are used to achieve the aforementioned objective, there are few researches about hydrogel design introducing sulfated polysaccharide from Enteromorpha prolifera (SPE), which is rich in hydroxyl, sulfate, and carboxyl groups providing amounts of reaction sites for hydrogel synthesis. Herein, conductive hydrogel (PAA-Al<sup>3+</sup>-SPE3) reinforced by SPE was designed by simple one pot hot polymerization method. This hydrogel demonstrated charming extension ratio (up to 4027.40 %), strain stress (up to 59.94 kPa), compressive strength (19.71 Mpa), and high conductivity sensibility (GF 6.76, 300 % - 700 %). Additionally, PAA-Al<sup>3+</sup>-SPE3 showed good self-healing property (repaired autonomously after 60 s) and satisfied self-adhesion (31.11 kPa) due to the reversible hydrogen bonds and metal coordination interactions. Furthermore, the PAA-Al<sup>3+</sup>-SPE3 hydrogel showed great real-time sensing performance to monitor various motions. These findings suggest the potential of PAA-Al<sup>3+</sup>-SPE3 hydrogel as an affordable and reliable conductive sensing material.

Multifunctional Reversible Self-Assembled Structures of Cellulose-Derived Phase-Change Nanocrystals.,"Owing to advantageous properties attributed to well-organized structures, multifunctional materials with reversible hierarchical and highly ordered arrangement in solid-state assembled structures have drawn tremendous interest. However, such materials rarely exist. Based on the reversible phase transition of phase-change materials (PCMs), phase-change nanocrystals (C18-UCNCs) are presented herein, which are capable of self-assembling into well-ordered hierarchical structures. C18-UCNCs have a core-shell structure consisting of a cellulose crystalline core that retains the basic structure and a soft shell containing octadecyl chains that allow phase transition. The distinct core-shell structure and phase transition of octadecyl chains allow C18-UCNCs to self-assemble into flaky nano/microstructures. These self-assembled C18-UCNCs exhibit efficient thermal transport and light-to-thermal energy conversion, and thus are promising for thermosensitive imaging. Specifically, flaky self-assembled nano/microstructures with manipulable surface morphology, surface wetting, and optical properties are thermoreversible and show thermally induced self-healing properties. By using phase-change nanocrystals as a novel group of PCMs, reversible self-assembled multifunctional materials can be engineered. This study proposes a promising approach for constructing self-assembled hierarchical structures by using phase-change nanocrystals and thereby significantly expands the application of PCMs.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2021,Jan
The Horizon of Materiobiology: A Perspective on Material-Guided Cell Behaviors and Tissue Engineering.,"Although the biological functions of cell and tissue can be regulated by biochemical factors (e.g., growth factors, hormones), the biophysical effects of materials on the regulation of biological activity are receiving more attention. In this Review, we systematically summarize the recent progress on how biomaterials with controllable properties (e.g., compositional/degradable dynamics, mechanical properties, 2D topography, and 3D geometry) can regulate cell behaviors (e.g., cell adhesion, spreading, proliferation, cell alignment, and the differentiation or self-maintenance of stem cells) and tissue/organ functions. How the biophysical features of materials influence tissue/organ regeneration have been elucidated. Current challenges and a perspective on the development of novel materials that can modulate specific biological functions are discussed. The interdependent relationship between biomaterials and biology leads us to propose the concept of ""materiobiology"", which is a scientific discipline that studies the biological effects of the properties of biomaterials on biological functions at cell, tissue, organ, and the whole organism levels. This Review highlights that it is more important to develop ECM-mimicking biomaterials having a self-regenerative capacity to stimulate tissue regeneration, instead of attempting to recreate the complexity of living tissues or tissue constructs ex vivo. The principles of materiobiology may benefit the development of novel biomaterials providing combinative bioactive cues to activate the migration of stem cells from endogenous reservoirs (i.e., cell niches), stimulate robust and scalable self-healing mechanisms, and unlock the body's innate powers of regeneration.",Chemical reviews,eng,2017,Mar

Multifunctional Flexible Sensor Based on PU-TA@MXene Janus Architecture for Selective Direction Recognition.,"Multifunctional selectivity and mechanical properties are always a focus of attention in the field of flexible sensors. In particular, the construction of biomimetic architecture for sensing materials can endow the fabricated sensors with intrinsic response features and extra-derived functions. Here, inspired by the asymmetric structural features of human skin, a novel tannic acid (TA)-modified MXene-polyurethane film with a bionic Janus architecture is proposed, which is prepared by gravity-driven self-assembly for the gradient dispersion of 2D TA@MXene nanosheets into a PU network. This obtained film reveals strong mechanical properties of a superior elongation at a break of 2056.67% and an ultimate tensile strength of 50.78 MPa with self-healing performance. Moreover, the Janus architecture can lead to a selective multifunctional response of flexible sensors to directional bending, pressure, and stretching. Combined with a machine learning module, the sensor is endowed with high recognition rates for force detection (96.1%). Meanwhile, direction identification in rescue operations and human movement monitoring can be realized by this sensor.

The fabrication of a highly efficient self-healing hydrogel from natural biopolymers loaded with exosomes for the synergistic promotion of severe wound healing.,"Unhealable diabetic wounds and disabling scar formation in severe wounds need to be addressed with the help of multiple techniques. Here we put forward an idea to use exosomes loaded into a supporting scaffold to rebuild the vascular transportation system, which could solve hypoxia and infertility in these wounds. A highly efficient self-healing and biocompatible natural-based methylcellulose-chitosan hydrogel loaded with biological exosome nanoparticles has the appropriate strength and is made by an easy preparation process, and it eventually achieves the integrated structure needed for healing severe diabetic conditions. Hydrogels perform well in the cell proliferation and skin remodeling stages because of their three-dimensional porous structure, and self-healing and adhesion properties. Also, exosomes accumulated to an effective concentration for a period of time could induce proliferation, especially relating to vascular formation. After the overpass (vascular) has been constructed with the help of the base (hydrogel) and workers (exosomes), the society (skin) is reconstructed under a system of supply and regulation. The research results indicate that these novel complex hydrogels loaded with exosomes provide wide prospects for the healing of severe wounds.",Biomaterials science,eng,2019,Dec
Rational multivalency construction enables bactericidal effect amplification and dynamic biomaterial design.,"The multivalency of bioligands in living systems brings inspiration for not only the discovery of biological mechanisms but also the design of extracellular matrix (ECM)-mimicking biomaterials. However, designing controllable multivalency construction strategies is still challenging. Herein, we synthesized a series of well-defined multivalent antimicrobial peptide polymers (mAMPs) by clicking ligand molecules onto polymers prepared by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The multiple cationic ligands in the mAMPs could enhance the local disturbance of the anionic phospholipid layer of the bacterial membrane through multivalent binding, leading to amplification of the bactericidal effect. In addition to multivalency-enhanced antibacterial activity, mAMPs also enable multivalency-assisted hydrogel fabrication with an ECM-like dynamic structure. The resultant hydrogel with self-healing and injectable properties could be successfully employed as an antibacterial biomaterial scaffold to treat infected skin wounds. The multivalency construction strategy presented in this work provides new ideas for the biomimetic design of highly active and dynamic biomaterials for tissue repair and regeneration.",Innovation (Cambridge (Mass.)),eng,2023,Sep
Injectable and Sprayable Polyphenol-Based Hydrogels for Controlling Hemostasis.,"Injectable and sprayable hydrogels have attracted considerable attention for application in the biomedical field owing to their high moldability and efficiency in encapsulating therapeutics and cells. Herein, we report the spontaneous assembly of injectable and sprayable hydrogels via a one-step mixing of solutions of tannic acid (TA) and <i>O</i>-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) without an external stimulus. The presence of 1,4-benzenediboronic acid (BDBA) improves the mechanical properties and reduces the gelation time of the resulting hydrogels. The hydrogels assemble via hydrogen bonds between TA and CMCS as well as via dynamic boronate ester bonds between TA and BDBA, as confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Balancing the interactions between the three components (CMCS/TA/BDBA) is essential for the construction of the hydrogels. The moduli of the CMCS-TA-BDBA hydrogels initially increase as the amount of BDBA increases and decrease after reaching a maximum value at a BDBA-to-TA molar ratio of 3:1. The CMCS-TA-BDBA hydrogels with interconnected porous morphologies display rapid gelation (∼10 s), biocompatibility, self-healing, injectable, and sprayable abilities. In addition, the hydrogels can be used for hemostasis. The extent of bleeding in mouse livers treated with the hydrogels could be reduced extensively from 240 (nontreated mouse livers) to 55 mg (77% reduction). The reported hydrogels coupled with the combination of functionality and biological activity make them promising hemostatic materials for biomedical applications.",ACS applied bio materials,eng,2020,Feb
Complementing urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction for improved microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation.,"Microbial-induced CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation has been widely applied in bacterial-based self-healing concrete. However, the limited biogenetic CaCO<sub>3</sub> production by bacteria after they were introduced into the incompatible concrete matrix is a major challenge of this technology. In the present study, the potential of combining two metabolic pathways, urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction, simultaneously in one bacteria strain for improving the bacterial CaCO<sub>3</sub> yield has been investigated. One bacterial strain, Ralstonia eutropha H16, which has the highest Ca<sup>2+</sup> tolerance and is capable of performing both urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction in combined media was selected among three bacterial candidates based on the enzymatic examinations. Results showed that H16 does not need oxygen for urea hydrolysis and urease activity was determined primarily by cell concentration. However, the additional urea in the combined medium slowed down the nitrate reduction rate to 7 days until full NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> decomposition. Moreover, the nitrate reduction of H16 was significantly restricted by an increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentration in the media. Nevertheless, the overall CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation yield can be improved by 20 to 30% after optimization through the combination of two metabolic pathways. The highest total CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation yield achieved in an orthogonal experiment was 14 g/L. It can be concluded that Ralstonia eutropha H16 is a suitable bacterium for simultaneous activation of urea hydrolysis and nitrate reduction for improving the CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation and it can be studied later, on activation of multiple metabolic pathways in bacteria-based self-healing concrete.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2019,Nov
New Surface-Treatment Technique of Concrete Structures Using Crack Repair Stick with Healing Ingredients.,"This study focused on the development of a crack repair stick as a new repair method along with self-healing materials that can be used to easily repair the cracks in a concrete structure at the construction site. In developing this new repair technique, the self-healing efficiency of various cementitious materials was considered. Likewise, a crack repair stick was developed to apply to concrete structures with 0.3 mm or lower crack widths. The crack repair stick was made with different materials, such as cement, an expansive material (C<sub>12</sub>A₇), a swelling material, and calcium carbonate, to endow it with a self-healing property. To verify the performance of the crack repair stick for concrete structures, two types of procedures (field experiment and field absorption test) were carried out. As a result of such procedures, it was concluded that the developed crack repair stick could be used on concrete structures to reduce repair expenses and for the improved workability, usability, and serviceability of such structures. On the other hand, to evaluate the self-healing performance of the crack repair stick, various tests were conducted, such as the relative dynamic modulus of elasticity test, the water tightness test, the water permeability test, observation via a microscope, and scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis. From the results, it is found that water leakage can be prevented and that the durability of a concrete structure can be improved through self-healing. Also, it was verified that the cracks were perfectly closed after 28 days due to application of the crack repair stick. These results indicate the usability of the crack repair stick for concrete structures, and its self-healing efficiency.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2016,Aug
Nanofiber Composite Microchannel-Containing Injectable Hydrogels for Cartilage Tissue Regeneration.,"Articular cartilage tissue is incapable of self-repair and therapies for cartilage defects are still lacking. Injectable hydrogels have drawn much attention in the field of cartilage regeneration. Herein, the novel design of nanofiber composite microchannel-containing hydrogels inspired by the tunnel-piled structure of subway tunnels is proposed. Based on the aldehydized polyethylene glycol/carboxymethyl chitosan (APA/CMCS) hydrogels, thermosensitive gelatin microrods (GMs) are used as a pore-forming agent, and coaxial electrospinning polylactic acid/gelatin fibers (PGFs) loaded with kartogenin (KGN) are used as a reinforcing agent and a drug delivery system to construct the nanofiber composite microchannel-containing injectable hydrogels (APA/CMCS/KGN@PGF/GM hydrogels). The in situ formation, micromorphology and porosity, swelling and degradation, mechanical properties, self-healing behavior, as well as drug release of the nanofiber composite microchannel-containing hydrogels are investigated. The hydrogel exhibits good self-healing ability, and the introduction of PGF nanofibers can significantly improve the mechanical properties. The drug delivery system can realize sustained release of KGN to match the process of cartilage repair. The microchannel structure effectively promotes bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC) proliferation and ingrowth within the hydrogels. In vitro and animal experiments indicate that the APA/CMCS/KGN@PGF/GM hydrogels can enhance the chondrogenesis of BMSCs and promote neocartilage formation in the rabbit cartilage defect model.",Advanced healthcare materials,eng,2023,Sep
"A novel xanthan gum-based conductive hydrogel with excellent mechanical, biocompatible, and self-healing performances.","Tough and conductive hydrogels are promising materials for various applications. However, it remains a great challenge to develop an integrated hydrogel combining outstanding mechanical, conductive, and self-healing performances. Herein, we prepared a conductive, self-healing, and tough hydrogel by constructing synergistic multiple interaction among montmorillonite (MMT), Poly (acrylamide-co-acrylonitrile) (P(AAm-co-AN)), xanthan gum (XG) and ferric ion (Fe<sup>3+</sup>). The obtained xanthan gum/montmorillonite/Poly (acrylamide-co-acrylonitrile) (XG/MMT/PAAm) hydrogels showed high strain stress (0.48 MPa) and compressive stress (5.9 MPa) as well as good shape recovery after multiple loading-unloading cycle tests. Moreover, the XG/MMT/PAAm hydrogels have distinctive features such as remarkable resistance to fatigue and harsh environments, insensitivity to notch, conductive, biocompatible, pH-dependent swelling behaviors and self-healing. Therefore, the as-fabricated hydrogel delivers a new prospect for its applications in various fields, such as flexible conductive device and tissue engineering.",Carbohydrate polymers,eng,2020,Nov
Dual Reversible Network Nanoarchitectonics for Ultrafast Light-Controlled Healable and Tough Polydimethylsiloxane-Based Composite Elastomers.,"It is highly desirable to develop polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers with high self-healing efficiency and excellent mechanical properties. However, most self-healable materials reported to date still take several hours to self-heal and improving the self-healing property often comes at the expense of mechanical properties. Herein, a simple design strategy of dual reversible network nanoarchitectonics is reported for constructing ultrafast light-controlled healable (40 s) and tough (≈7.2 MJ m<sup>-3</sup>) PDMS-based composite elastomers. The rupture reconstruction of dynamic bonds and the reinforcement effect of carbon nanotubes (10 wt %) endowed our composite elastomer with excellent fracture toughness that originated from a good yield strength (≈1.1 MPa) and stretchability (≈882%). Moreover, carbon nanotubes can quickly and directly heat the damaged area of the composite to achieve its ultrafast repair with the assistance of dynamic polymer/filler interfacial interaction, greatly shortening the self-healing time (12 h). The self-healing performance is superior to that of reported self-healable PDMS-based materials. This novel strategy and the as-prepared supramolecular elastomer can inspire further various practical applications, such as remote anti-icing/deicing materials.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,Aug
In-Depth Profiling of Calcite Precipitation by Environmental Bacteria Reveals Fundamental Mechanistic Differences with Relevance to Application.,"Microbially induced calcite precipitation (MICP) has not only helped to shape our planet's geological features but is also a promising technology to address environmental concerns in civil engineering applications. However, limited understanding of the biomineralization capacity of environmental bacteria impedes application. We therefore surveyed the environment for different mechanisms of precipitation across bacteria. The most fundamental difference was in ureolytic ability, where urease-positive bacteria caused rapid, widespread increases in pH, whereas nonureolytic strains produced such changes slowly and locally. These pH shifts correlated well with patterns of precipitation on solid medium. Strikingly, while both mechanisms led to high levels of precipitation, we observed clear differences in the precipitate. Ureolytic bacteria produced homogenous, inorganic fine crystals, whereas the crystals of nonureolytic strains were larger and had a mixed organic/inorganic composition. When representative strains were tested in application for crack healing in cement mortars, nonureolytic bacteria gave robust results, while ureolytic strains showed more variation. This may be explained by our observation that urease activity differed between growth conditions or by the different natures and therefore different material performances of the precipitates. Our results shed light on the breadth of biomineralization activity among environmental bacteria, an important step toward the rational design of bacterially based engineering solutions.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Biomineralization triggered by bacteria is important in the natural environment and has many applications in industry and in civil and geotechnical engineering. The diversity in biomineralization capabilities of environmental bacteria is, however, not well understood. This study surveyed environmental bacteria for their ability to precipitate calcium carbonate minerals and investigated both the mechanisms and the resulting crystals. We show that while urease activity leads to the fastest precipitation, it is by no means essential. Importantly, the same quantities of calcium carbonate are produced by nonureolytic bacteria, and the resulting crystals appear to have larger volumes and more organic components, which are likely beneficial in specific applications. Testing both precipitation mechanisms in a self-healing concrete application showed that nonureolytic bacteria delivered more robust results. Here, we performed a systematic study of the fundamental differences in biomineralization between environmental bacteria, and we provide important information for the design of bacterially based engineering solutions.",Applied and environmental microbiology,eng,2020,Mar
A hierarchical system of covalent and dual non-covalent crosslinks promotes the toughness and self-healing properties of polymer hydrogels.,"While it is challenging to simultaneously achieve both high mechanical performance and self-healing ability within one polymer hydrogel network, we, herein, synthesized a novel class of hydrogels based on a combination of chemical and dual non-covalent crosslinks <i>via</i> micellar polymerization of 3-isocyanatomethyl-3,5,5-trimethylcyclohexyl isocyanate, end-capped by 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (IPDI-HEMA), with acrylamide (AM). The prepared hydrogels were demonstrated to possess a tensile elongation at a break of at least 1900%, a fracture energy of 138.4 kJ m<sup>-3</sup>, and remarkable self-healing behaviors (<i>e.g.</i>, a strong self-healing ability achieved at ambient temperature without the need for any stimulus or healing agent). The multiple crosslinks developed in this study for one polymer hydrogel network are significant steps to construct the desired functional hydrogels with excellent self-healing and mechanical properties.",Journal of materials chemistry.

An Innovative Approach to Control Steel Reinforcement Corrosion by Self-Healing.,"The corrosion of reinforced steel, and subsequent reinforced concrete degradation, is a major concern for infrastructure durability. New materials with specific, tailor-made properties or the establishment of optimum construction regimes are among the many approaches to improving civil structure performance. Ideally, novel materials would carry self-repairing or self-healing capacities, triggered in the event of detrimental influence and/or damage. Controlling or altering a material's behavior at the nano-level would result in traditional materials with radically enhanced properties. Nevertheless, nanotechnology applications are still rare in construction, and would break new ground in engineering practice. An approach to controlling the corrosion-related degradation of reinforced concrete was designed as a synergetic action of electrochemistry, cement chemistry and nanotechnology. This contribution presents the concept of the approach, namely to simultaneously achieve steel corrosion resistance and improved bulk matrix properties. The technical background and challenges for the application of polymeric nanomaterials in the field are briefly outlined in view of this concept, which has the added value of self-healing. The credibility of the approach is discussed with reference to previously reported outcomes, and is illustrated via the results of the steel electrochemical responses and microscopic evaluations of the discussed materials.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2018,Feb
Constructive adaptation of 3D-printable polymers in response to typically destructive aquatic environments.,"In response to environmental stressors, biological systems exhibit extraordinary adaptive capacity by turning destructive environmental stressors into constructive factors; however, the traditional engineering materials weaken and fail. Take the response of polymers to an aquatic environment as an example: Water molecules typically compromise the mechanical properties of the polymer network in the bulk and on the interface through swelling and lubrication, respectively. Here, we report a class of 3D-printable synthetic polymers that constructively strengthen their bulk and interfacial mechanical properties in response to the aquatic environment. The mechanism relies on a water-assisted additional cross-linking reaction in the polymer matrix and on the interface. As such, the typically destructive water can constructively enhance the polymer's bulk mechanical properties such as stiffness, tensile strength, and fracture toughness by factors of 746% to 790%, and the interfacial bonding by a factor of 1,000%. We show that the invented polymers can be used for soft robotics that self-strengthen matrix and self-heal cracks after training in water and water-healable packaging materials for flexible electronics. This work opens the door for the design of synthetic materials to imitate the constructive adaptation of biological systems in response to environmental stressors, for applications such as artificial muscles, soft robotics, and flexible electronics.",PNAS nexus,eng,2022,Jul
Enzymatically mediated Gleditsia sinensis galactomannan based hydrogel inspired by wound healing process.,"The self-healing property based on metal-ligand physical coordination is particularly interesting in bio-hydrogel science due to its allowance for multiple local healing events to process. As the most abundant renewable green resource in nature, Gleditsia sinensis galactomannan has great potential as a starting material for functional materials. In this study, the biocompatible Gleditsia sinensis galactomannan and cellulose were firstly chemically modified and then taken as the main constituent for constructing the metal-ligand coordination through an enzyme-regulated strategy. The hydrogel could quickly gelatinize in the surrounding environment, corresponding to the violent exothermic phenomenon, and exhibit extraordinary self-healing behavior. The molecular dynamics simulation of the hydrogel confirmed the more stable coordinated configuration from Fe(III)-chelates than Fe(II)-chelates. The morphology, mechanical property, antibacterial, and cytotoxicity of the prepared hydrogel were also studied. Our results indicated that galactomannan hydrogel based on the metal-ligand networks could balance the kinetic stability and intrinsic healability through the enzyme-induced route, which provide a new perspective in the field of biomaterial applications.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2023,Mar
Tuning Hydrogels by Mixing Dynamic Cross-Linkers: Enabling Cell-Instructive Hydrogels and Advanced Bioinks.,"Rational design of hydrogels that balance processability and extracellular matrix (ECM) biomimicry remains a challenge for tissue engineering and biofabrication. Hydrogels suitable for biofabrication techniques, yet tuneable to match the mechanical (static and dynamic) properties of native tissues remain elusive. Dynamic covalent hydrogels possessing shear-thinning/self-healing (processability) and time-dependent cross-links (mechanical properties) provide a potential solution, yet can be difficult to rationally control. Here, the straightforward modular mixing of dynamic cross-links with different timescales (hydrazone and oxime) is explored using rheology, self-healing tests, extrusion printing, and culture of primary human dermal fibroblasts. Maintaining a constant polymer content and cross-linker concentration, the stiffness and stress relaxation can be tuned across two orders of magnitude. All formulations demonstrate a similar flow profile after network rupture, allowing the separation of initial mechanical properties from flow behavior during printing. Furthermore, the self-healing nature of hydrogels with high hydrazone content enables recyclability of printed structures. Last, a distinct threshold for cell spreading and morphology is observed within this hydrogel series, even in multi-material constructs. Simple cross-linker mixing enables fine control and is of general interest for bioink development, targeting viscoelastic properties of specific cellular niches, and as an accessible and flexible platform for designing dynamic networks.",Advanced healthcare materials,eng,2022,Jan
Multifunctional Supramolecular Hydrogel for Prevention of Epidural Adhesion after Laminectomy.,"Postoperative epidural adhesion remains a clinically challenging problem in spine surgery. Currently there are no effective and safe antifibrotic and antiadhesion biomaterials that have been specifically developed for this complication in clinical practice. Herein we designed and engineered an advanced antiadhesion hydrogel with multiple functionalities, including temperature-responsive gelation, self-healing, tissue adhesiveness, antioxidation, anti-inflammation, and antifibrosis. This multifunctional supramolecular hydrogel can be facilely constructed by integrating three functional modules, <i>i</i>.<i>e</i>., a thermosensitive triblock copolymer, poloxamer 407 (PX); a reactive oxygen species-eliminating and anti-inflammatory nanoparticle (TPCD NP); and an adhesion-enhancing compound, tannic acid (TA). The optimal formulation (PXNT) was hierarchically screened based on <i>in vitro</i> properties and <i>in vivo</i> activities. Therapeutically, local treatment with PXNT hydrogel effectively prevented epidural fibrosis and adhesion after laminectomy in both rats and rabbits. Of note, PXNT hydrogel showed more beneficial efficacy than different control thermosensitive hydrogels and a commercially available barrier product, Interceed. Mechanistically, PXNT hydrogel significantly attenuated local oxidative stress, inhibited inflammatory responses, and reduced fibrotic tissue formation. Moreover, treatment with PXNT hydrogel did not cause systemic adverse effects and neurological symptoms. Consequently, PXNT hydrogel is a highly promising biomaterial for preventing postlaminectomy epidural adhesion and adhesions after other surgeries.",ACS nano,eng,2020,Jul
Ultrastretchable Conductive Polymer Complex as a Strain Sensor with a Repeatable Autonomous Self-Healing Ability.,"Wearable strain sensors are essential for the realization of applications in the broad fields of remote healthcare monitoring, soft robots, and immersive gaming, among many others. These flexible sensors should be comfortably adhered to the skin and capable of monitoring human motions with high accuracy, as well as exhibiting excellent durability. However, it is challenging to develop electronic materials that possess the properties of skin-compliant, elastic, stretchable, and self-healable. This work demonstrates a new regenerative polymer complex composed of poly(2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid), polyaniline, and phytic acid as a skin-like electronic material. It exhibits ultrahigh stretchability (1935%), repeatable autonomous self-healing ability (repeating healing efficiency >98%), quadratic response to strain ( R<sup>2</sup> > 0.9998), and linear response to flexion bending ( R<sup>2</sup> > 0.9994), outperforming current reported wearable strain sensors. The deprotonated polyelectrolyte, multivalent anion, and doped conductive polymer, under ambient conditions, synergistically construct a regenerative dynamic network of polymer complex cross-linked by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, which enables ultrahigh stretchability and repeatable self-healing. Sensitive strain-responsive geometric and piezoresistive mechanisms of the material owing to the homogeneous and viscoelastic nature provide excellent linear responses to omnidirectional tensile strain and bending deformations. Furthermore, this material is scalable and simple to process in an environmentally friendly manner, paving the way for the next-generation flexible electronics.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2019,Jun
Bioinspired self-healing injectable nanocomposite hydrogels based on oxidized dextran and gelatin for growth-factor-free bone regeneration.,"Hydrogels with great biocompatibility, biodegradability, and mechanical properties, combined with osteoconductivity, osteoinductivity, and osteointegration as biomaterials for bone regeneration without adding exogenous growth factors and cells are highly appealing but challenging. Here, inspired by organic-inorganic analogues of natural bone tissue and the adhesion chemistry of mussels, nanocomposite hydrogels with self-healing, injectable, adhesive, antioxidant, and osteoinductive properties (termed GO-PHA-CPs) were constructed by Schiff base cross-linking between dopamine-modified gelatin (Gel-DA) and oxidized dextran (ODex). Furthermore, the hydrogel network was enhanced by the introduction of polydopamine-functionalized nanohydroxyapatite (PHA) by improving the interfacial compatibility between the rigid inorganic particles and the flexible hydrogel matrix. Bioactive cod peptides (CPs) with osteogenic activity from Atlantic cod were further incorporated into the nanocomposite hydrogel. As a result, the multicomponent nanocomposite hydrogel favored the adhesion and spreading of MC3T3-E1 cells. The increased ALP activity suggested that GO-PHA-CPs hydrogels contributed to the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. The suitability of GO-PHA-CPs hydrogels for enhancing bone regeneration in vivo was further confirmed by the rat femoral defect model. Our results indicate that the multifunctional GO-PHA-CPs nanocomposite hydrogels without growth factors are a promising and effective candidate material for bone regeneration.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2023,Aug
Scalable Manufactured Self-Healing Strain Sensors Based on Ion-Intercalated Graphene Nanosheets and Interfacial Coordination.,"Desirable mechanical strength and self-healing performance are very important to highly sensitive and stretchable sensors to meet their practical applications. However, balancing these two key performance parameters is still a great challenge. Herein, we present a simple, large-scale, and cost-efficient route to fabricate autonomously self-healing strain sensors with satisfactory mechanical properties. Specifically, ion-intercalated mechanical milling was utilized to realize the large-scale preparation of graphene nanosheets (GNs). Then, a well-organized GN-nanostructured network was constructed in a rubber matrix based on interfacial metal-ligand coordination. The resultant nanocomposites show desirable mechanical properties (∼5 times higher than that of control sample without interfacial coordination), excellent self-healing performance (even healable in various harsh conditions, for example, underwater, at subzero temperature or exposed in acidic and alkaline conditions), and ultrahigh sensitivity (gauge factor ≈ 45 573.1).

Rosin-Based Epoxy Vitrimers with Dynamic Boronic Ester Bonds.,"Rosin is an abundantly available natural product. In this paper, for the first time, a rosin derivative is employed as the main monomer for preparation of epoxy vitrimers to improve the mechanical properties of vitrimers. Novel epoxy vitrimer networks with dynamic reversible covalent boronic ester bonds are constructed by a reaction between thiols in 2,2'-(1,4-phenylene)-bis (4-mercaptan-1,3,2-dioxaborolane) (BDB) as a curing agent and epoxy groups in the rosin derivative. The rosin-based epoxy vitrimer networks are fully characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), an equilibrium swelling experiment, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The obtained rosin-based epoxy vitrimers possess superior thermostability and good mechanical properties. Due to transesterification of boronic ester bonds, rosin epoxy vitrimer network topologies can be altered, giving welding, recycle, self-healing, and shape memory abilities to the fabricated polymer. Besides, the effects of treating time and temperature on welding capability is investigated, and it is found that the welding efficiency of the 20% C-FPAE sample is >93% after treatment for 12 h at 160 °C. Moreover, through a hot press, the pulverized samples of 20% C-FPAE can be reshaped several times and most mechanical properties are restored after reprocessing at 200 °C for 60 min. Finally, chemical degradation is researched for the rosin-based epoxy vitrimers.",Polymers,eng,2021,Oct
"Stimuli-Responsive, Pentapeptide, Nanofiber Hydrogel for Tissue Engineering.","Short peptides are uniquely versatile building blocks for self-assembly. Supramolecular peptide assemblies can be used to construct functional hydrogel biomaterials-an attractive approach for neural tissue engineering. Here, we report a new class of short, five-residue peptides that form hydrogels with nanofiber structures. Using rheology and spectroscopy, we describe how sequence variations, pH, and peptide concentration alter the mechanical properties of our pentapeptide hydrogels. We find that this class of seven unmodified peptides forms robust hydrogels from 0.2-20 kPa at low weight percent (less than 3 wt %) in cell culture media and undergoes shear-thinning and rapid self-healing. The peptides self-assemble into long fibrils with sequence-dependent fibrillar morphologies. These fibrils exhibit a unique twisted ribbon shape, as visualized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Cryo-EM imaging, with diameters in the low tens of nanometers and periodicities similar to amyloid fibrils. Experimental gelation behavior corroborates our molecular dynamics simulations, which demonstrate peptide assembly behavior, an increase in β-sheet content, and patterns of variation in solvent accessibility. Our rapidly assembling pentapeptides for injectable delivery (RAPID) hydrogels are syringe-injectable and support cytocompatible encapsulation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), as well as their proliferation and three-dimensional process extension. Furthermore, RAPID gels protect OPCs from mechanical membrane disruption and acute loss of viability when ejected from a syringe needle, highlighting the protective capability of the hydrogel as potential cell carriers for transplantation therapies. The tunable mechanical and structural properties of these supramolecular assemblies are shown to be permissive to cell expansion and remodeling, making this hydrogel system suitable as an injectable material for cell delivery and tissue engineering applications.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,eng,2019,Mar
"Self-Healable, Strong, and Tough Polyurethane Elastomer Enabled by Carbamate-Containing Chain Extenders Derived from Ethyl Carbonate.","Commercial diol chain extenders generally could only form two urethane bonds, while abundant hydrogen bonds were required to construct self-healing thermoplastic polyurethane elastomers (TPU).

"Tunicate inspired gelatin-based tough hydrogel wound dressing containing twisted phthalazinone with adhesive, self-healing and antibacterial properties.","As a hydrolytic product of collagen, gelatin is a polypeptide of biological origin. Gelatin hydrogels emerge as promising material candidates for traditional dressings due to good biocompatibility and the ability to keep wounds moist. However, it is difficult to simultaneously achieve gelatin hydrogel with robust mechanical property for long-term usage, reliable tissue adhesion, self-healing and antibacterial properties. Herein, we propose a simply synthesized strategy of a multifunctional gelatin hydrogel dressing, which is constructed by conjugating a newly synthesized 2-(4'-aldehydephenyl)-4-(2',3',4'-trihydroxyphenyl)-2,3-phthalazine-1(2H)-one (THPZB) to gelatin with Schiff base and chelating with Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions (termed G/THPZB/Fe hydrogel). The twisted structure of phthalazinone in THPZB leads to entanglement of gelatin molecular chains, which resolves the stiffness-toughness conflict of the hydrogel. Furthermore, the strong tissue adhesion and fast self-healing capability mainly originate from the hydrogen bonding of the pyrogallol in THPZB. In vitro study shows that the hydrogels possess good biocompatibility with L929 cells, hemostatic and antibacterial activity. In the rat model of skin infection, the hydrogel dressing not only have no adverse effects on vital organs, but also can effectively promote wound healing of bacterial infection.

Interfacial Binding Energy between Calcium-Silicate-Hydrates and Epoxy Resin: A Molecular Dynamics Study.,"Microcapsules encapsulated within epoxy as a curing agent have been successfully applied in self-healing materials, in which the healing performance significantly depends on the binding behaviour of the epoxy curing agent with the cement matrix. In this paper, the binding energy was investigated by molecular dynamics simulation, which could overcome the shortcomings of traditional microscopic experimental methods. In addition to the construction of different molecular models of epoxy, curing agents, and dilutants, seven models were established to investigate the effects of chain length, curing agent, and epoxy resin chain direction on the interfacial binding energy. The results showed that an increase of chain length exhibited had limited effect on the binding energy, while the curing agent and the direction of the epoxy significantly affected the interfacial binding energy. Among different factors, the curing agent tetrethylenepentamine exhibited the highest value of interfacial binding energy by an increment of 31.03 kcal/mol, indicating a better binding ability of the microcapsule core and the cement matrix.

Microfluidics-Assisted Assembly of Injectable Photonic Hydrogels toward Reflective Cooling.,"Development of fast curing and easy modeling of colloidal photonic crystals is highly desirable for various applications. Here, a novel type of injectable photonic hydrogel (IPH) is proposed to achieve self-healable structural color by integrating microfluidics-derived photonic supraballs with supramolecular hydrogels. The supramolecular hydrogel is engineered via incorporating β-cyclodextrin/poly(2-hydroxypropyl acrylate-co-N-vinylimidazole) (CD/poly(HPA-co-VI)) with methacrylated gelatin (GelMA), and serves as a scaffold for colloidal crystal arrays.

By virtue of hydrogen bonds and host-guest interactions, a series of self-healable photonic hydrogels (linear, planar, and spiral assemblies) can be facilely assembled. It is demonstrated that the spherical symmetry of the photonic supraballs endows them with identical optical responses independent of viewing angles. In addition, by taking the advantage of angle independent spectrum characteristics, the IPH presents beneficial effects in reflective cooling, which can achieve up to 17.4 °C in passive solar reflective cooling.

Shape-Recoverable Hyaluronic Acid-Waterborne Polyurethane Hybrid Cryogel Accelerates Hemostasis and Wound Healing.,"Wound dressings that promote quick hemostasis and are highly efficient in healing wounds are urgently needed to meet the increase in clinical demands worldwide. Herein, a dihydrazide-modified waterborne biodegradable polyurethane emulsion (PU-ADH) and oxidized hyaluronic acid (OHA) were autonomously cross-linked to form a hybrid hyaluronic acid-polyurethane (HA-PU) cryogel by hydrazone bonding at -20 °C. Through its specific macroporous structure (which is approximately 220 μm) constructed by aggregated PU-ADH particles and long-chain OHA, a dried cryogel can have a dramatically compressed volume (1/7 of its original volume) with stable fixation, and it can swell rapidly by absorbing water or blood to approximately 22 and 16 times its dried weight, respectively, in a few minutes. This instantaneous shape-recovering ability favors fast hemostasis in minimally invasive surgery. Moreover, this cryogel is superior to gauze, has excellent biocompatibility, and quickly coagulates blood (in approximately 2 min) by activating the endogenous coagulation system. Comparably, an injectable HA-PU hydrogel with the same components as the HA-PU cryogel was prepared at room temperature, and it exhibited good self-healing properties. An <i>in vivo</i> evaluation of a rat liver hemostasis model and rat skin defect model revealed that the cryogel in fast hemostasis has great potential and superior wound-healing abilities, decreases immune inflammation, and promotes the regeneration of angiogenesis and hair follicles. Consequently, this work proposes a versatile method for constructing biodegradable hybrid cryogels via autonomous cross-linking between synthesized polymer emulsions and natural polymers. The hybrid cryogels demonstrated great potential for applications as high-performance wound dressings.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Apr
Hierarchical hydrogen bonds directed multi-functional carbon nanotube-based supramolecular hydrogels.,"Supramolecular hydrogels (SMHs) are three-dimensional networks filled with a large amount of water. The crosslinking force in the 3D network is always constructed by relatively weak and dynamic non-covalent interactions, and thus SMHs usually possess extremely high susceptibility to external environment and can show extraordinary stimuli-responsive, self-healing or other attractive properties. However, the overall crosslinking force in hydrogel networks is difficult to flexibly modulate, and this leads to limited functions of the SMHs. In this regard, hierarchical hydrogen bonds, that is, the mixture of relatively strong and relatively weak hydrogen bonds, are used herein as crosslinking force for the hydrogel preparation. The ratio of strong and weak hydrogen bonds can be finely tuned to tailor the properties of resultant gels. Thus, by delicate manipulation of the overall crosslinking force in the system, a hydrogel with multiple (thermal, pH and NIR light) responsiveness, autonomous self-healing property and interesting temperature dependent, reversible adhesion behavior is obtained. This kind of hierarchical hydrogen bond manipulation is proved to be a general method for multiple-functionality hydrogel preparation, and the resultant material shows potential for a range of applications.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",eng,2014,Apr
Bacteria incorporated with calcium lactate pentahydrate to improve the mortar properties and self-healing occurrence.,"Concrete can be harmful to the environment due to its high energy consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> emission and also has a potential crack formation, which can promote a drop in its strength. Therefore, concrete is considered as a non-sustainable material. The mechanisms by which bacterial oxidation of organic carbon can precipitate calcite that may fill the voids and cracks on cement-based materials have been extensively investigated to prevent and heal the micro-cracks formation. Hence, this study focused on utilizing a new alkaliphilic bacterial strain indigenous to an Indonesian site, Lysinibacillus sphaericus strain SKC/VA-1, incorporated with calcium lactate pentahydrate, as a low-cost calcium source, with various bacterial inoculum concentrations. The bacterium was employed in this study due to its ability to adapt to basic pH, thus improving the physical properties and rejuvenating the micro-cracks. Experimentally, the addition of calcium lactate pentahydrate slightly affected the mortar properties. Likewise, bacteria-incorporated mortar exhibited an enhancement in the physical properties of mortar. The highest improvement of mechanical properties (an increase of 45% and 36% for compressive and indirect tensile strength, respectively) was achieved by the addition of calcium lactate pentahydrate incorporated with 10% v/v bacterial inoculum [about 7 × 10<sup>7</sup> CFU/ml (colony-forming unit/ml)]. The self-healing took place more rapidly on bacterial mortar supplemented with calcium lactate pentahydrate than on the control specimen. XRD analysis demonstrated that the mineralogical composition of self-healing precipitates was primarily dominated by calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>), indicating the capacity of L. sphaericus strain SKC/VA-1 to precipitate calcite through organic carbon oxidation for self-healing the artificial crack on the mortar. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the potential utilization of the bacterium L. sphaericus incorporated with calcium lactate pentahydrate to increase the mortar properties, including its self-healing ability. However, further study with the water-cement ratio variation is required to investigate the possibility of using L. sphaericus and calcium lactate pentahydrate as an alternative method rather than reducing the water-cement ratio to enhance the mortar properties.",Scientific reports,eng,2020,Oct
"High-Strength, Tough, Fatigue Resistant, and Self-Healing Hydrogel Based on Dual Physically Cross-Linked Network.","Hydrogels usually suffer from low mechanical strength, which largely limit their application in many fields. In this Research Article, we prepared a dual physically cross-linked hydrogel composed of poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (PAM-co-PAA) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) by simple two-steps methods of copolymerization and freezing/thawing. The hydrogen bond-associated entanglement of copolymer chains formed as cross-linking points to construct the first network. After being subjected to the freezing/thawing treatment, PVA crystalline domains were formed to serve as knots of the second network. The hydrogels were demonstrated to integrate strength and toughness (1230 ± 90 kPa and 1250 ± 50 kJ/m(3)) by the introduction of second physically cross-linked network. What̀s more, the hydrogels exhibited rapid recovery, excellent fatigue resistance, and self-healing property. The dynamic property of the dual physically cross-linked network contributes to the excellent energy dissipation and self-healing property. Therefore, this work provides a new route to understand the toughness mechanism of dual physically cross-linked hydrogels, hopefully promoting current hydrogel research and expanding their applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2016,Sep
Multiscale Fatigue Performance Evaluation of Hydrated Lime and Basalt Fiber Modified Asphalt Mixture.,"Long-life pavement construction is an important research direction for sustainable road development. Fatigue cracking of aging asphalt pavement is one of the main reasons that affects its service life, and improving the fatigue resistance of aging asphalt pavement has become a key factor in promoting the development of long-life pavement. In order to enhance the fatigue resistance of aging asphalt pavement, hydrated lime and basalt fiber were selected to prepare a modified asphalt mixture. The resistance to fatigue is evaluated by the four-point bending fatigue test and self-healing compensation test, based on the energy method, the phenomenon-based approach, and other methods. The results of each method of evaluation were also compared and analyzed. The results indicate that the incorporation of hydrated lime can improve the adhesion of the asphalt binder, while the incorporation of basalt fiber can stabilize the internal structure. When incorporated alone, basalt fiber has no noticeable effect, while hydrated lime significantly improves the fatigue performance of the mixture after thermal aging. Mixing both ingredients produced the best improvement effect under various conditions, with a fatigue life improvement of 53%. In the multi-scale evaluation of fatigue performance, it was found that the initial stiffness modulus was unsuitable as a direct evaluation index of fatigue performance. Using the fatigue damage rate or the stable value of dissipated energy change rate as an evaluation index can clearly characterize the fatigue performance of the mixture before and after aging. The self-healing rate and self-healing decay index clearly reflected the fatigue damage healing process under repeated loading and could be used as relevant indices for evaluating the new-scale fatigue performance of asphalt mixtures.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2023,May
Nitrite producing bacteria inhibit reinforcement bar corrosion in cementitious materials.,"Chemicals and synthetic coatings are widely used to protect steel against corrosion. Bio-based corrosion inhibition strategies can be an alternative in the arising bioeconomy era. To maintain the good state of steel reinforcement in cracked concrete, microbe-based self-healing cementitious composites (MSCC) have been developed. Yet, proposed strategies involve reasonably slow crack filling by biomineralization and thus risk the possible rebar corrosion during crack healing. Here we upgrade the rebar protection to a higher level by combining MSCC with microbial induced corrosion inhibition. Presented NO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> reducing bacterial granules inhibit rebar corrosion by producing the anodic corrosion inhibitor NO<sub>2</sub><sup>-</sup> and meanwhile heal a 300-µm-wide crack in 28 days. During 120 days exposure to 0.5 M Cl<sup>-</sup> solution, the rebars in cracked MSCC keep showing open circuit potentials above the critical value of -250 mV and they lose less than 2% of the total rebar material which corresponds to half the material loss in cracked plain mortar. Overall, the obtained rebar protection performance is comparable with that of uncracked mortar and mortar containing chemical inhibitor, hence the microbe-based system becomes an alternative to the traditional methods.",Scientific reports,eng,2018,Sep

Molecular interaction mechanisms of glycol chitosan self-healing hydrogel as a drug delivery system for gemcitabine and doxorubicin.,"Glycol chitosan is a derivative of chitosan that has attracted attention in recent years due to its biocompatibility and biodegradability. Due to its unique biological characteristics, it has been widely used in hydrogels and biomaterials. In this study, we explored the loading efficiency of a self-healing hydrogel (GC-DP) comprising glycol chitosan (GC) and telechelic difunctional poly(ethylene glycol) (DF-PEG) for delivering the anticancer drugs gemcitabine and doxorubicin through full atomistic simulations. We also constructed full atomistic models of the two drug delivery systems at three drug concentrations of 10%, 40%, and 80% to understand how the drug concentration affects the loading efficiency and molecular structure of the GC-DP hydrogels. Through the analysis of the results, we show that the GC-DP hydrogel exhibits excellent loading efficiency for both gemcitabine and doxorubicin at all drug concentrations (10%, 40% and 80%). Our results reveal that the main mechanism of interaction between the GC-DP hydrogels and gemcitabine is van der Waals adsorption and that the dominant interactions between the GC-DP hydrogel and doxorubicin are hydrogen bonds for the D10 model and van der Waals adsorption for the D40 and D80 models. Our results provide molecular insights into how drug molecules are carried by hydrogel materials and indicate that the GC-DP hydrogel is a promising candidate for carrying both gemcitabine and doxorubicin, and thus serving as a novel drug carrier for cancer treatment.",Computational and structural biotechnology journal,eng,2022,No Data
Self-Assembly of Silk-like Protein into Nanoscale Bicontinuous Networks under Phase-Separation Conditions.,"Liquid-liquid phase separation of biomacromolecules is crucial in various inter- and extracellular biological functions. This includes formation of condensates to control, e.g., biochemical reactions and structural assembly. The same phenomenon is also found to be critically important in protein-based high-performance biological materials. Here, we use a well-characterized model triblock protein system to demonstrate the molecular level formation mechanism and structure of its condensate. Large-scale molecular modeling supported by analytical ultracentrifuge characterization combined with our earlier high magnification precision cryo-SEM microscopy imaging leads to deducing that the condensate has a bicontinuous network structure. The bicontinuous network rises from the proteins having a combination of sites with stronger mutual attraction and multiple weakly attractive regions connected by flexible, multiconfigurational linker regions. These attractive sites and regions behave as stickers of varying adhesion strength. For the examined model triblock protein construct, the β-sheet-rich end units are the stronger stickers, while additional weaker stickers, contributing to the condensation affinity, rise from spring-like connections in the flexible middle region of the protein. The combination of stronger and weaker sticker-like connections and the flexible regions between the stickers result in a versatile, liquid-like, self-healing structure. This structure also explains the high flexibility, easy deformability, and diffusion of the proteins, decreasing only 10-100 times in the bicontinuous network formed in the condensate phase in comparison to dilute protein solution. The here demonstrated structure and condensation mechanism of a model triblock protein construct via a combination of the stronger binding regions and the weaker, flexible sacrificial-bond-like network as well as its generalizability via polymer sticker models provide means to not only understand intracellular organization, regulation, and cellular function but also to identify direct control factors for and to enable engineering improved protein and polymer constructs to enhance control of advanced fiber materials, smart liquid biointerfaces, or self-healing matrices for pharmaceutics or bioengineering materials.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2021,Feb
Construction of Wearable Touch Sensors by Mimicking the Properties of Materials and Structures in Nature.,"Wearable touch sensors, which can convert force or pressure signals into quantitative electronic signals, have emerged as essential smart sensing devices and play an important role in various cutting-edge fields, including wearable health monitoring, soft robots, electronic skin, artificial prosthetics, AR/VR, and the Internet of Things.

"Multi-layered cement-hydrogel composite with high toughness, low thermal conductivity, and self-healing capability.","The inherent quasi-brittleness of cement-based materials, due to the disorder of their hydration products and pore structures, present significant challenges for directional matrix toughening. In this work, a rigid layered skeleton of cement slurry was prepared using a simplified ice-template method, and subsequently flexible polyvinyl alcohol hydrogel was introduced into the unidirectional pores between neighboring cement platelets, resulting in the formation of a multi-layered cement-based composite. A toughness improvement of over 175 times is achieved by the implantation of such hard-soft alternatively layered microstructure. The toughening mechanism is the stretching of hydrogels at the nano-scale and deflections of micro-cracks at the interfaces, which avoid stress concentration and dissipate huge energy. Furthermore, this cement-hydrogel composite also exhibits a low thermal conductivity (around 1/10 of normal cement) and density, high specific strength and self-healing properties, which can be used in thermal insulation, seismic high-rise buildings and long-span bridges.",Nature communications,eng,2023,Jun
Bacillus sphaericus LMG 22257 is physiologically suitable for self-healing concrete.,"The suitability of using a spore-forming ureolytic strain, Bacillus sphaericus, was evaluated for self-healing of concrete cracks. The main focus was on alkaline tolerance, calcium tolerance, oxygen dependence, and low-temperature adaptability. Experimental results show that B. sphaericus had a good tolerance. It can grow and germinate in a broad range of alkaline pH. The optimal pH range is 7 ∼ 9. High alkaline conditions (pH 10 ∼ 11) slow down but not stop the growth and germination. Oxygen was strictly needed during bacterial growth and germination, but not an essential factor during bacterial urea decomposition. B. sphaericus also had a good Ca tolerance, especially at a high bacterial concentration of 10<sup>8</sup> cells/mL; no significant influence was observed on bacterial ureolytic activity of the presence of 0.9M Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, at a low temperature (10 °C), bacterial spores germinated and revived ureolytic activity with some retardation. However, this retardation can be counteracted by using a higher bacterial concentration and by supplementing yeast extract. It can be concluded that B. sphaericus is a suitable bacterium for application in bacteria-based self-healing concrete.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2017,Jun
Highly elastic and self-healing nanostructured gelatin/clay colloidal gels with osteogenic capacity for minimally invasive and customized bone regeneration.,"Extrusible biomaterials have recently attracted increasing attention due to the desirable injectability and printability to allow minimally invasive administration and precise construction of tissue mimics. Specifically, self-healing colloidal gels are a novel class of candidate materials as injectables or printable inks considering their fascinating viscoelastic behavior and high degree of freedom on tailoring their compositional and mechanical properties. Herein, we developed a novel class of adaptable and osteogenic composite colloidal gels via electrostatic assembly of gelatin nanoparticles and nanoclay particles. These composite gels exhibited excellent injectability and printability, and remarkable mechanical properties reflected by the maximal elastic modulus reaching ∼150 kPa combined with high self-healing efficiency, outperforming most previously reported self-healing hydrogels. Moreover, the cytocompatibility and the osteogenic capacity of the colloidal gels were demonstrated by inductive culture of MC3T3 cells seeded on the three-dimensional (3D)-printed colloidal scaffolds. Besides, the biocompatibility and biodegradability of the colloidal gels was proved<i>in vivo</i>by subcutaneous implantation of the 3D-printed scaffolds. Furthermore, we investigated the therapeutic capacity of the colloidal gels, either in form of injectable gels or 3D-printed bone substitutes, using rat sinus bone augmentation model or critical-sized cranial defect model. The results confirmed that the composite gels were able to adapt to the local complexity including irregular or customized defect shapes and continuous on-site mechanical stimuli, but also to realize osteointegrity with the surrounding bone tissues and eventually be replaced by newly formed bones.",Biofabrication,eng,2023,Jan
"Modular Construction of a Tessellated Octahedron, its Hierarchical Spherical Aggregate Behavior, and Electrocatalytic CO<sub>2</sub> Reduction Activity.","Coordination-driven self-assembly has led to the formation of various aesthetical polyhedrons and compounds with advanced functions.

These architectures have diameters on the order of 10.9 nm and molecular weights greater than 84 kDa.

Engineered Injectable Cell-Laden Chitin/Chitosan Hydrogel with Adhesion and Biodegradability for Calvarial Defect Regeneration.,"Trade-off of high-strength and dynamic crosslinking of hydrogels remains an enormous challenge. Motivated by the self-healing property of biological tissues, the strategy of combining multiple dynamic bond mechanisms and a polysaccharide network is proposed to fabricate biomimetic hydrogels with sufficient mechanical strength, injectability, biodegradability, and self-healing property for bone reconstruction engineering. Stable acylhydrazone bonds endowed hydrogels with robust mechanical strength (>10 kPa). The integration of dynamic imine bonds and acylhydrazone bonds optimized the reversible characteristic to protect the cell during the injection and mimicked ECM microenvironment for cell differentiation as well as rapid adapting bone defect area. Furthermore, due to the slow enzymatic hydrolysis kinetics of chitosan and the self-healing properties of resulting networks, hydrogels exhibited a satisfactory biodegradation period (>8 weeks) that highly matches with bone regeneration. Additionally, rBMSC-laden hydrogels exhibited splendid osteogenic induction and bone reconstruction without prefabrication scaffolds and incubation, demonstrating tremendous potential for clinical application. This work proposes an efficient strategy for the construction of a low-cost multifunctional hydrogel, making polysaccharide-based hydrogels as the optimal carrier for enabling cellular functions in bone repair.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,May
"1,2-Dithiolane-Derived Dynamic, Covalent Materials: Cooperative Self-Assembly and Reversible Cross-Linking.","The use of dithiolane-containing polymers to construct responsive and dynamic networks is an attractive strategy in material design. Here, we provide a detailed mechanistic study on the self-assembly and gelation behavior of a class of ABA triblock copolymers containing a central poly(ethylene oxide) block and terminal polycarbonate blocks with pendant 1,2-dithiolane functionalities. In aqueous solution, these amphiphilic block copolymers self-assemble into bridged flower micelles at high concentrations. The addition of a thiol initiates the reversible ring-opening polymerizations of dithiolanes in the micellar cores to induce the cross-linking and gelation of the micellar network. The properties of the resulting hydrogels depend sensitively on the structures of 1,2-dithiolanes. While the methyl asparagusic acid-derived hydrogels are highly dynamic, adaptable, and self-healing, those derived from lipoic acid are rigid, resilient, and brittle. The thermodynamics and kinetics of ring-opening polymerization of the two dithiolanes were investigated to provide important insights on the dramatically different properties of the hydrogels derived from the two different dithiolanes. The incorporation of both dithiolane monomers into the block copolymers provides a facile way to tailor the properties of these hydrogels.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,eng,2017,Mar
Construction of Smart Supramolecular Polymeric Hydrogels Cross-linked by Discrete Organoplatinum(II) Metallacycles via Post-Assembly Polymerization.,"Postassembly modification strategy has been successfully employed in the construction of discrete metallosupramolecular assemblies. However, the most known reports have been limited to the simple structural conversion through the easy covalent reactions, thus hindering the development of organometallic functional materials. In this study, we first combined coordination-driven self-assembly and postassembly reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization to produce a new family of star supramolecular polymers containing well-defined metallacycles as cores, which featured typical lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior in water because of the existence of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAM) moieties. Moreover, the obtained star polymers could further form supramolecular hydrogels cross-linked by discrete hexagonal metallacycles at room temperature without heating-cooling process. Interestingly, the resultant polymeric hydrogels exhibited stimuli-responsive behavior toward temperature and bromide anion as well as self-healing property. We demonstrated that the dynamic nature of Pt-N bonds in the hexagonal metallacycles played an important role in determining the stimuli-responsive and self-healing property of the final soft matters. Thus, merging coordination-driven self-assembly and postassembly polymerization provided a new avenue to the preparation of functional materials containing well-defined, discrete metal-organic assemblies as main scaffolds.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,eng,2016,Apr
Facile immobilization of graphene nanosheets onto PBO fibers via MOF-mediated coagulation strategy: Multifunctional interface with self-healing and ultraviolet-resistance performance.,"The surface of poly (p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers with self-healing and ultraviolet (UV)-resistance performance play the key role in prolonging their service lifespan. Although great advances have been made in the single aspect of above two properties, integration of self-healing and anti-UV performance into the surface of PBO fiber is still a challenge. In this study, the coagulation strategy mediated by metal-organic framework (MOF) is proposed to construct the multifunctional surface of PBO fibers. The spindle-like iron (III)-based MOF (MIL-88B-NH<sub>2</sub>) nanocrystals are firstly immobilized onto the surface of PBO-COOH through hydrothermal reaction, then serving as the medium layer to further immobilize sufficient graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets. Benefitting from the favorable near-infrared (NIR, 808 nm) photothermal conversion performance of GO nanolayers, the monofilament composite-PBO@Fe-MIL-88B-NH<sub>2</sub>-GO-TPU (thermoplastic polyurethane) exhibited a stable and high self-healing efficiency (approximately 80%) within five cycle times. Meanwhile, the cooperative adsorption and shielding weaken effects of MOF-GO nanolayers enabled PBO fibers with excellent anti-UV properties that are superior to much reported literatures after 96 h aging time and eventually increased by 75% compared with untreated PBO fiber. In view of the varieties and multifunctionalities of MOFs and carbon nanomaterials, MOF-mediated coagulation strategy would provide guidance for preparing multifunctional composite materials.",Journal of colloid and interface science,eng,2021,Apr
A DNA-Based Molecular System That Can Autonomously Add and Extract Components.,"Many molecular systems in nature undergo autonomous addition and extraction of components in order to execute diverse functions, which rely on molecular components that can sense, process, and transmit information from the environment. Building artificial molecular systems using a similar strategy may lead to the construction of life-like synthetic materials. Herein, we report the design of a dynamic multicomponent molecular system from DNA self-assembly, which is capable of autonomously adding and extracting molecular components initiated by molecular triggers. Orthogonality was integrated into molecular components by harnessing the design capacity of DNA sequences. As a proof of concept, we built a three-component DNA tubular system, which can selectively add or extract one, two, or three components in an orthogonal and programmable manner. We further demonstrated that molecular extraction may be designed in response to environmental cues such as protons. Moreover, the tubes can be disassembled on demand to facilitate their uptake by cells. This work may prime the design of artificial multicomponent molecular systems with increasing complexity, diversity, and functionality that may guide the development of new synthetic materials beyond DNA self-assembly.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Sep

A Chewing Gum Residue-Based Gel with Superior Mechanical Properties and Self-Healability for Flexible Wearable Sensor.,"Chewing gum residue is hard to decompose and easy to cause pollution, which is highly desirable to realize recycling. In this paper, a chewing gum gel with enhanced mechanical properties and self-healing properties is prepared by using polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as the backbone in chewing gum residue. The hydrogen bond and the borax ester bond are employed to construct reversible interaction to enhance the self-healing ability. The physical crosslinking is realized by further freeze-thaw treatment to improve its mechanical properties. The gel demonstrates high elongation at break of 610% and strength of 0.11 MPa, as well as excellent self-healing performance and recyclable properties. In particular, the gel with a fast signal response is successfully applied as a wearable strain sensor to monitor different types of human motion. The gel as a sensor exhibits self-healing properties suggesting superior safety and stability, and displays wide linear sensitivity (the gauge factor is 0.417 and 0.170). The gel can be further served to explore temperature changes, implying the application in temperature monitoring. This study develops a novel approach for the recycle and reuse of chewing gum residue.

Light-Mediated Synthesis and Reprocessing of Dynamic Bottlebrush Elastomers under Ambient Conditions.,"We introduce a novel grafting-through polymerization strategy to synthesize dynamic bottlebrush polymers and elastomers in one step using light to construct a disulfide-containing backbone. The key starting material-α-lipoic acid (LA)-is commercially available, inexpensive, and biocompatible. When installed on the chain end(s) of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), the cyclic disulfide unit derived from LA polymerizes under ultraviolet (UV) light in ambient conditions. Significantly, no additives such as initiator, solvent, or catalyst are required for efficient gelation. Formulations that include bis-LA-functionalized cross-linker yield bottlebrush elastomers with high gel fractions (83-98%) and tunable, supersoft shear moduli in the ∼20-200 kPa range. An added advantage of these materials is the dynamic disulfide bonds along each bottlebrush backbone, which allow for light-mediated self-healing and on-demand chemical degradation. These results highlight the potential of simple and scalable synthetic routes to generate unique bottlebrush polymers and elastomers based on PDMS.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,eng,2021,Jul
Low-cost cultivation and sporulation of alkaliphilic <i>Bacillus</i> sp. strain AK13 for self-healing concrete.,"The alkaliphilic, calcium carbonate precipitating <i>Bacillus</i> sp. strain AK13 can be utilized in concrete for self-repairing. A statistical experimental design was used to develop an economical medium for its mass cultivation and sporulation. Two types of screening experiment were first conducted to identify substrates that promote the growth of the AK13 strain: the first followed a one-factor-at-a-time factorial design and the second a two-level full factorial design. Based on these screening experiments, barley malt powder and mixed grain powder were identified as the substrates that most effectively promoted the growth of the AK13 strain from a range of 21 agricultural products and by-products. A quadratic statistical model was then constructed using a central composite design and the concentration of the two substrates was optimized. The estimated growth and sporulation of <i>Bacillus</i> sp. strain AK13 in the proposed medium were 3.08 ± 0.38 × 10<sup>8</sup> and 1.25 ± 0.12 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml, respectively, which meant that the proposed low-cost medium was approximately 45 times more effective than the commercial medium in terms of the number of cultivatable bacteria per unit price. The spores were then powdered via a spray-drying process to produce a spore powder with a spore count of 2.0 ± 0.7 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/g. The AK13 spore powder was mixed with cement paste, yeast extract, calcium lactate, and water. The yeast extract and calcium lactate generated the highest CFU/ml for AK13 at a 0.4:0.4 ratio compared to 0.4:0.25 (the original ratio of the B4 medium) and 0.4:0.8. Twenty-eight days after the spores were mixed into the mortar, the number of vegetative cells and spores of the AK13 strain had reached 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/g within the mortar. Cracks in the mortar under 0.29 mm were healed in 14 days. Calcium carbonate precipitation was observed on the crack surface. The mortar containing the spore powder was thus concluded to be effective in terms of healing micro-cracks.",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2019,Dec
Screening of bacteria for self-healing of concrete cracks and optimization of the microbial calcium precipitation process.,"A novel high-throughput strategy was developed to determine the calcium precipitation activity (CPA) of mineralization bacteria used for self-healing of concrete cracks. A bacterial strain designated as H4 with the highest CPA of 94.8 % was screened and identified as a Bacillus species based on 16S rDNA sequence and phylogenetic tree analysis. Furthermore, the effects of certain influential factors on the microbial calcium precipitation process of H4 were evaluated. The results showed that lactate and nitrate are the best carbon and nitrogen sources, with optimal concentrations of approximately 25 and 18 mM, respectively. The H4 strain is able to maintain a high CPA in the pH range of 9.5-11.0, and a suitable initial spore concentration is 4.0 × 10(7) spores/ml. Moreover, an ambient Ca(2+) concentration greater than 60 mM resulted in a serious adverse impact not only on the CPA but also on the growth of H4, suggesting that the maintenance of the Ca(2+) concentration at a low level is necessary for microbial self-healing of concrete cracks.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2016,Aug
"A Highly Stretchable, Real-Time Self-Healable Hydrogel Adhesive Matrix for Tissue Patches and Flexible Electronics.","The development of biocompatible self-healable hydrogel adhesives for skin or wet, stretchable surfaces in air or under water is highly desirable for various biomedical applications ranging from skin patches to bioelectronics. However, it has been proven to be very challenging because most existing hydrogel adhesives are cytotoxic, or poorly adhere to dynamic or stretchable surfaces in wet environments. In this study, multifunctional hydrogel adhesives derived from silk fibroin (SF) and tannic acid (TA) are effectively constructed with high extensibility (i.e., up to 32 000%), real-time self-healing capability, underwater adhesivity, water-sealing ability, biocompatibility, and antibiotic properties. According to all-atom molecular dynamics simulation studies, the properties of the hydrogel adhesives, especially high extensibility, are mainly attributed to the hydrogen bonds between TA and the SF chains in water, and water and TA molecules can result in loose assemblies with fewer β-sheets, and more random coils in the SF. Conductivity can also be easily introduced to the adhesive matrix and adjusted when the strain of the adhesives occurs. Considering that it has multiple functions and can be efficiently prepared, the proposed hydrogel adhesives have the potential for future medical applications, such as tissue adhesives and integrated bioelectronics.",Advanced healthcare materials,eng,2020,Feb
Ultrafast construction of partially hydrogen-bonded metal-hyaluronan networks with multiple biotissue-related features.,"This paper reports a versatile and dynamic hydrogel system based on ultrafast coordination between partially hydrogen-bonded (PHB) biopolymer hyaluronic acid and a series of transition metal ions at appropriate pH values. It was found that the procedure for the hydrogel synthesis was extremely facile, requiring a simple mixing of the components within 2 s. The hydrogels exhibited high water content, up to 96 %. Even so, the hydrogels can be stretched >50 times and rapidly self-heal from damage within only 10 s without using any healing agents or heating. Furthermore, this dynamic hydrogel network underwent reversible sol-gel transitions as response to multiple disparate stimuli, including pH, temperature, ions, redox, and light. The photo-patterning ability of the hydrogel with a rapid gel-sol transition upon exposure to light was also demonstrated. We disclosed the principle and methodology to use PHB metal-biopolymer systems for constructing dynamic bio-related soft matters.",Carbohydrate polymers,eng,2022,Nov
Controlling the calcium carbonate microstructure of engineered living building materials.,"The fabrication of responsive soft materials that enable the controlled release of microbial induced calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) precipitation (MICP) would be highly desirable for the creation of living materials that can be used, for example, as self-healing construction materials. To obtain a tight control over the mechanical properties of these materials, needed for civil engineering applications, the amount, location, and structure of the forming minerals must be precisely tuned; this requires good control over the dynamic functionality of bacteria. Despite recent advances in the self-healing of concrete cracks and the understanding of the role of synthesis conditions on the CaCO<sub>3</sub> polymorphic regulation, the degree of control over the CaCO<sub>3</sub> remains insufficient to meet these requirements. We demonstrate that the amount and location of CaCO<sub>3</sub> produced within a matrix, can be controlled through the concentration and location of bacteria; these parameters can be precisely tuned if bacteria are encapsulated, as we demonstrate with the soil-dwelling bacterium <i>Sporosarcina pasteurii</i> that is deposited within biocompatible alginate and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) hydrogels. Using a competitive ligand exchange mechanism that relies on the presence of yeast extract, we control the timing of the release of calcium ions that crosslink the alginate or CMC without compromising bacterial viability. With this novel use of hydrogel encapsulation of bacteria for on-demand release of MICP, we achieve control over the amount and structure of CaCO<sub>3</sub>-based composites and demonstrate that <i>S. pasteurii</i> can be stored for up to 3 months at an accessible storage temperature of 4 °C, which are two important factors that currently limit the applicability of MICP for the reinforcement of construction materials. These composites thus have the potential to sense, respond, and heal without the need for external intervention.",Journal of materials chemistry. A,eng,2021,Nov
"A super-stretchable, self-healing and injectable supramolecular hydrogel constructed by a host-guest crosslinker.","Supramolecular hydrogels based on host-guest interactions have drawn considerable attention due to their unique properties and promising applications. However, it is still a great challenge to construct supramolecular hydrogels that simultaneously achieve mechanical strength, processability, and biocompatibility. Herein, we present a rational design of a ""supramolecular crosslinker"" approach to fabricate a new host-guest hydrogel with super-stretchability, self-healing, and injectable properties and excellent biocompatibility. The star-shaped supramolecular crosslinker is formed by the host-guest interactions between octa-cyclodextrin polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (OCDPOSS) and acrylamide-modified adamantane (Ad-AAm). Supramolecular hydrogels can be briefly prepared by UV-initiated copolymerization of acrylamide and supramolecular crosslinkers. Supramolecular hydrogels present impressive mechanical properties due to rigid POSS as the core of the supramolecular crosslinker. Moreover, multivalent host-guest interactions improve the ductility, rapid self-healing and injectable ability of these hydrogels. Simultaneously, these supramolecular hydrogels possess good biocompatibility and can be utilized as carriers for the sustained release of hydrophobic drugs.

"Rapid Printing and Patterning of Tough, Self-Healable, and Recyclable Hydrogel Thin-Films toward Flexible Sensing Devices.","Direct and rapid printing and surface patterning of hydrogel thin films are of great significance in the construction of advanced electronic devices, yet they are greatly underdeveloped due to the intrinsic contradiction between mechanical strength and self-healability as well as recyclability. Here, we present a universal and rapid slipping-directed route with a newly developed water-soluble star polymer hydrogel for direct and reproducible printing and patterning of freestanding functional thin films with precisely controlled thicknesses, components, and surface structures on a large scale. The resulting thin films combine the features of large transmittance (93%), tough mechanical strength (114 MPa), multiresponsive self-healability, recyclability, and remarkable multifunctionality. With the unique humidity-sensitive properties as motivation, diverse humidity-sensing devices including an actuating switch, a supercapacitive sensor, and a noncontact electronic skin are facilely constructed through the humidity-induced transverse, longitudinal, and patterning assembly techniques, respectively. The method presented here is universal and efficient in the fabrication and assembly of thin films with controlled configuration and functionality for advanced flexible electronics.",Nano letters,eng,2022,Oct
Diatomaceous earth as a protective vehicle for bacteria applied for self-healing concrete.,"Crack repair is crucial since cracks are the main cause for the decreased service life of concrete structures. An original and promising way to repair cracks is to pre-incorporate healing agents inside the concrete matrix to heal cracks the moment they appear. Thus, the concrete obtains self-healing properties. The goal of our research is to apply bacterially precipitated CaCO₃ to heal cracks in concrete since the microbial calcium carbonate is more compatible with the concrete matrix and more environmentally friendly relative to the normally used polymeric materials. Diatomaceous earth (DE) was used in this study to protect bacteria from the high-pH environment of concrete. The experimental results showed that DE had a very good protective effect for bacteria. DE immobilized bacteria had much higher ureolytic activity (12-17 g/l urea was decomposed within 3 days) than that of un-immobilized bacteria (less than 1 g/l urea was decomposed within the same time span) in cement slurry. The optimal concentration of DE for immobilization was 60% (w/v, weight of DE/volume of bacterial suspension). Self-healing in cracked specimens was visualized under light microscopy. The images showed that cracks with a width ranging from 0.15 to 0.17 mm in the specimens containing DE immobilized bacteria were completely filled by the precipitation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectrometry (EDS) were used to characterize the precipitation around the crack wall, which was confirmed to be calcium carbonate. The result from a capillary water absorption test showed that the specimens with DE immobilized bacteria had the lowest water absorption (30% of the reference ones), which indicated that the precipitation inside the cracks increased the water penetration resistance of the cracked specimens.",Journal of industrial microbiology & biotechnology,eng,2012,Apr
Photothermal-Induced Self-Healable and Reconfigurable Shape Memory Bio-Based Elastomer with Recyclable Ability.,"Photothermal-induced self-healable and shape memory materials have drawn much attention due to the rapidly growing technical applications and environmental requirements. As epoxy natural rubber (ENR) is a kind of bio-based elastomer with good mechanical properties, weather resistance, and air impermeability, it is of great significance to incorporate ENR with recyclable, photothermal-induced self-healable and shape memory properties. In this study, we report a simple method to cross-link ENR with dodecanedioic acids (DAs) through esterification reaction, and during the cross-linking process, a little aniline trimer (ACAT, a kind of oligoaniline) was added at the same time. Then, the ENR-DA-ACAT vitrimers that were covalently cross-linked with recyclable, self-healable, and multiple responsive properties were obtained, which also possessed various functions. As a result of the transesterification reactions at elevated temperatures, the ENR-based vitrimers possess the ability to be reprocessed and self-healed, and the mechanical properties could be maintained even after three consecutive breaking/mold pressing cycles. Besides, the vitrimer is also responsive to near-infrared (NIR) light and pH with the introduction of ACAT, and we also find that ACAT can be used as a catalyst to accelerate the transesterification reaction. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the ENR-DA-ACAT vitrimer could also be used to construct the reconfigurable shape memory polymer; the shape fixing ratio and shape recovery ratio are both above 95% in the reconfiguration process, and the multistage shape memory performance can also be achieved by NIR irradiation, which will potentially lead to a wide application for ENR in the field of actuators.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2019,Jan
Super Tough and Self-Healable Poly(dimethylsiloxane) Elastomer via Hydrogen Bonding Association and Its Applications as Triboelectric Nanogenerators.,"Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as one of the electron-drawing materials has been widely used in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENG), which is expected to generate electron through friction and required to endure dynamic loads. However, the nature of the siloxane bond and the low interchain interaction between the methyl side groups result in low fracture energy in PDMS elastomers. Here, a strategy that combined the advantages of the dynamic of hierarchical hydrogen bonding and phase-separation-like structure was adopted to improve the toughness of PDMS elastomers. By varying both stronger and weaker hydrogen bonding within the PDMS network, a series of super tough (up to 24,000 J/m<sup>2</sup>), notch-insensitive, transparent, and autonomous self-healable elastomers were achieved. In addition, a hydrophilic polymeric material (PDMAS-U10) was synthesized as the conductive layer. A transparent TENG was fabricated by sandwiching the PDMAS-U10 between two pieces of the PDMS elastomer. Despite its hydrophilic nature, PDMAS-U10 exhibit strong adhesion interaction with hydrophobic PDMS elastomers. As such, a tough (16,500 J/m<sup>2</sup>), self-healable (efficiency ∼97%), and transparent triboelectric nanogenerator was constructed. A self-powered system employing the TENG is also demonstrated in this work.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Jul
"Mussel-Inspired Bisphosphonated Injectable Nanocomposite Hydrogels with Adhesive, Self-Healing, and Osteogenic Properties for Bone Regeneration.","Injectable hydrogels have received much attention because of the advantages of simulation of the natural extracellular matrix, microinvasive implantation, and filling and repairing of complex shape defects. Yet, for bone repair, the current injectable hydrogels have shown significant limitations such as the lack of tissue adhesion, deficiency of self-healing ability, and absence of osteogenic activity. Herein, a strategy to construct mussel-inspired bisphosphonated injectable nanocomposite hydrogels with adhesive, self-healing, and osteogenic properties is developed. The nano-hydroxyapatite/poly(l-glutamic acid)-dextran (nHA/PLGA-Dex) dually cross-linked (DC) injectable hydrogels are fabricated via Schiff base cross-linking and noncovalent nHA-BP chelation. The chelation between bisphosphonate ligands (alendronate sodium, BP) and nHA favors the uniform dispersion of the latter. Moreover, multiple adhesion ligands based on catechol motifs, BP, and aldehyde groups endow the hydrogels with good tissue adhesion. The hydrogels possess excellent biocompatibility and the introduction of BP and nHA both can effectively promote viability, proliferation, migration, and osteogenesis differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells. The incorporation of BP groups and HA nanoparticles could also facilitate the angiogenic property of endothelial cells. The nHA/PLGA-Dex DC hydrogels exhibited considerable biocompatibility despite the presence of a certain degree of inflammatory response in the early stage. The successful healing of a rat cranial defect further proves the bone regeneration ability of nHA/PLGA-Dex DC injectable hydrogels. The developed tissue adhesive osteogenic injectable nHA/PLGA-Dex hydrogels show significant potential for bone regeneration application.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Jul
"A structure-supporting, self-healing, and high permeating hydrogel bioink for establishment of diverse homogeneous tissue-like constructs.","The ready-to-use, structure-supporting hydrogel bioink can shorten the time for ink preparation, ensure cell dispersion, and maintain the preset shape/microstructure without additional assistance during printing. Meanwhile, ink with high permeability might facilitate uniform cell growth in biological constructs, which is beneficial to homogeneous tissue repair. Unfortunately, current bioinks are hard to meet these requirements simultaneously in a simple way. Here, based on the fast dynamic crosslinking of aldehyde hyaluronic acid (AHA)/N-carboxymethyl chitosan (CMC) and the slow stable crosslinking of gelatin (GEL)/4-arm poly(ethylene glycol) succinimidyl glutarate (PEG-SG), we present a time-sharing structure-supporting (TSHSP) hydrogel bioink with high permeability, containing 1% AHA, 0.75% CMC, 1% GEL and 0.5% PEG-SG. The TSHSP hydrogel can facilitate printing with proper viscoelastic property and self-healing behavior. By crosslinking with 4% PEG-SG for only 3 min, the integrity of the cell-laden construct can last for 21 days due to the stable internal and external GEL/PEG-SG networks, and cells manifested long-term viability and spreading morphology. Nerve-like, muscle-like, and cartilage-like <i>in vitro</i> constructs exhibited homogeneous cell growth and remarkable biological specificities.

Stimuli-responsive supramolecular polymers in aqueous solution.,"CONSPECTUS: Aiming to construct various novel supramolecular polymeric structures in aqueous solution beyond small supramolecular self-assembly molecules and develop functional supramolecular polymeric materials, research interest on functional supramolecular polymers has been prevailing in recent years. Supramolecular polymers are formed by bridging monomers or components together via highly directional noncovalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interaction, π-π interaction, metal-ligand coordination, electrostatic interaction, and so forth. They can be easily functionalized by employing diverse building components with specific functions besides the traditional polymeric properties, a number of which are responsive to such external stimuli as pH variance, photoirradiation, chemically or electrochemically redox with the controllable conformation or construction switching, polymerization building and rebuilding, and function adjustment reversibly owing to the reversibility of noncovalent interactions. Supramolecular polymers are ""soft matters"" and can be functionalized with specific properties such as morphology adjustment, controllable luminescence, shape memory, self-healing, and so forth. Supramolecular polymers constructed based on macrocycle recognition and interlocked structures represent one typical branch of the supramolecular polymer family. Cyclodextrin (CD), cucurbituril (CB), and hydrophilic calixarene derivatives are usually employed to construct hydrophilic supramolecular polymers in aqueous solution. Stimuli-responsive hydrophilic supramolecular polymers, constructed in aqueous solution particularly, can be promising candidates for mimicking biocompatible or vital functional materials. This Account mainly focuses on the recent stimuli-responsive supramolecular polymers based on the host-guest interaction in aqueous solution. We describe the hydrophilic supramolecular polymers constructed via hydrophobic effects, electrostatic interaction, metal-ligand coordination, and multiple combinations of the above noncovalent interactions. The disparate ways to engender stimuli-responsive supramolecular polymers via the hydrophobic effects of α-CD, β-CD, and γ-CD macrocycles are illustrated and discussed. Some recent works on CD-based photoresponsive functional supramolecular polymers are summarized. CB (especially CB[8]) based supramolecular polymers and their pH-responsive and photoresponsive properties are introduced. Hydrophilic calixarene derivative (bis(p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene) typically) based supramolecular polymers via electrostatic interactions are reviewed, and their redox-responsive association/disassociation elaborated in detail. More complicate supramolecular polymers based on multiple noncovalent interactions are illustrated including hydrophobic effect, metal-ligand coordination, and electrostatic interactions and their functional stimuli-responsiveness elaborated as well. Finally, we give perspectives on the strength of these diverse noncovalent interactions to form supramolecular polymers in aqueous solution, on the advantage, disadvantage, efficiency, and reversibility of using certain stimuli in constructing supramolecular polymers and prospect the future function improvement of these polymers as functional materials.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2014,Jul
3-D tissue-engineered epidermis against human primary keratinocytes apoptosis via relieving mitochondrial oxidative stress in wound healing.,"The tissue-engineered epidermal (TEE), composed of biocompatible vectors and autogenous functional cells, is a novel strategy to solve the problem of shortage of donor skin sources. The human primary keratinocyte (HPK), the major skin components, are self-evident vital in wound healing and was considered as one of the preferred seed cells for TEEs. Since the process of separating HPKs from the skin triggers a stress state of the cells, achieving its rapid adhesion and proliferation on biomaterials remains challenging. The key to the clinical application is to ensure the normal function of cells while improving the proliferation ability in vitro, and to complete the complex mesenchymal epithelialization to achieve tissue remodeling after vivo implantation. Herein, in order to aid HPKs adhesion and proliferation in vitro and promoting wound healing, we developed a three dimensional collagen scaffold with Y-27632 sustainedly released from the nanoplatform, hollow mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (HMON). The results showed that the porous structure within the TEE supports the implanted HPKs expanding in a three-dimensional mode to jointly construct the tissue-engineered epidermis in vitro and inhibited the mitochondria-mediated cell apoptosis. It was confirmed that the TEEs with suitable degradation rate could maintain drug release after implantation and could accelerate vascularization of wound base and further revealed the involvement of mesenchymal transformation of transplanted HPKs during skin regeneration in a nude mouse model with full-thickness skin resection. In conclusion, our study highlights the great potential of constructing TEE using a nanoparticle platform for the treatment of large-area skin defects.",Journal of tissue engineering,eng,2023,No Data

Injectable hyaluronan/MnO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite hydrogel constructed by metal-hydrazide coordinated crosslink mineralization for relieving tumor hypoxia and combined phototherapy.,"Hydrogel-based drug delivery holds great promise in topical tumor treatment. However, the simple construction of multifunctional therapeutic hydrogels under physiological conditions is still a huge challenge. Herein, for the first time, a multifunctional hyaluronan/MnO<sub>2</sub> nanocomposite (HHM) hydrogel with injectable and self-healing capabilities was constructed under physiological conditions through innovative in situ mineralization-triggered Mn-hydrazide coordination crosslinking.

Preparation of stretchable and self-healable dual ionically cross-linked hydrogel based on chitosan/polyacrylic acid with anti-freezing property for multi-model flexible sensing and detection.,"As a kind of promising material for flexible wearable electronics, conductive hydrogels have attracted extensive interests of researchers for their inherent merits such as superior mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and permeability. Herein, we constructed a new type of highly stretchable, anti-freezing, self-healable, and conductive hydrogel based on chitosan/polyacrylic acid. The large amount of ions inside the network had five functions for the proposed hydrogel, including excellent mechanical behaviors, high conductivity, self-recovery, self-healing and anti-freezing capability. Consequently, the proposed hydrogel possessed tunable stretchability (1190-1550%), tensile strength (0.96-2.56 MPa), toughness (5.7-14.7 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>), superior self-healing property (self-healing efficiency up to 83.7%), high conductivity (4.58-5.76 S/m), and excellent anti-freezing capability. To our knowledge, the self-healable hydrogel with balanced tensile strength, toughness, conductivity, and low-temperature tolerance can hardly be achieved till now. Furthermore, the conductive hydrogels exhibited high sensitivity (gauge factor up to 10.8) in a broad strain window (0-1000%) and could detect the conventional motion signals of human body such as bending of a knuckle, swallowing, and pressure signal at both room temperature and -20 °C.

Herein, ceria nanorods with distinctive antiglycative and excellent antioxidative capacities are innovatively introduced into a self-healing and erasable hydrogel, which could reshape the wound microenvironment by expediting hemostasis, inhibiting infection, reducing AGEs, and continuously depleting reactive oxygen species. The remitted oxidative stress and glycosylation synergistically regulate inflammatory responses, and promote revascularization and extracellular matrix deposition, resulting in accelerated diabetic wound repair. This study provides a highly efficient strategy for constructing nanoenzyme-reinforced antiglycative hydrogel that regulates every wound healing stage for diabetic wound management.",Small methods,eng,2022,Nov
Colorimetric pH-responsive and hemostatic hydrogel-based bioadhesives containing functionalized silver nanoparticles.,"Here we develop and characterize a dual-cross-linked pH-responsive hydrogel based on the carboxyethyl chitosan-oxidized sodium alginate (CAO) containing silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) functionalized with tannic acid/red cabbage (ATR). This hybrid hydrogel is formed via covalent and non-covalent cross-linking. The adhesive strength measured in contact with cow skin and compression strength is measured more than 3 times higher than that of CAO. Importantly, the incorporation of 1 ​wt% ATR into CAO significantly enhances the compression strength of CAO from 35.1 ​± ​2.1 ​kPa to 97.5 ​± ​2.9 ​kPa. Moreover, the cyclic compression tests confirm significantly higher elastic behavior of CAO after the addition of ATR-functionalized NPs to CAO. The CAO/ATR hydrogel is pH-sensitive and indicated remarkable color changes in different buffer solutions. The CAO/ATR also shows improved hemostatic properties and reduced clotting time compared to the clotting time of blood in contact with CAO hydrogel. In addition, while CAO/ATR is effective in inhibiting the growth of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, CAO is only effective in inhibiting the growth of Gram-positive bacteria. Finally, the CAO/ATR hydrogel is cytocompatible with L929 fibroblasts. In summary, the resulting CAO/ATR hydrogel shows promising results in designing and constructing smart wound bioadhesives with high cytocompatibility, antibacterial properties, blood coagulation ability, and fast self-healing properties.",Materials today.

It is shown that these materials have ultimate toughness values >16 MJ cm<sup>-3</sup>, comparable to high-performance literature precedents. Significantly, the treatment of these networks with excess thiols facilitates thiol-thioester exchange that degrades polymerized networks into functional oligomers. These oligomers are shown to be amenable to repolymerization into constructs with varying thermomechanical properties, including elastomeric networks that recover their shape fully from >100% strain.

Development of reprocessable novel sulfur-containing epoxy based on thermal treatment.,"Inspired by the Diels-Alder reaction (DA reaction), the product of the reaction of 2-thiophenecarboxaldehyde (TCD) with epichlorohydrin (ECH) was combined with 1,4-anthraquinone to form a DA structure (a sulfur-containing self-healing epoxy resin (EP-DA) containing a large amount of π-electrons) was synthesized. The chemical structure, thermal properties, thermo-reversibility and tribological properties of EP-DA were studied by FTIR, DSC, gel-sol conversion and MRH-3G, respectively. The results indicated that the as-prepared epoxy composite network, which contains the thermally reversible D-A bond, enabled the epoxy resin to undergo self-repair. Moreover, the waste epoxy resin can be recycled and reused. The friction and wear of the epoxy during actual use were simulated. Macroscopic qualitative observation and quantitative measurement of shearing and peeling recovery were combined to examine the repair behavior and reprocessing ability of EP-DA, confirming that this material has good performance of self-repair and reprocessability, with the highest repair efficiency of up to 83.4%. Moreover, the introduced sulfur-containing diene body greatly improved the lubricating performance of the material, and the treatment time of waste reprocessing had a great influence on the content of the sulfur-containing epoxy monomer in the final EP-DA film. It was often possible to determine the degree of recovery of frictional properties.

Directed Self-Assembly of Dimeric Building Blocks into Networklike Protein Origami to Construct Hydrogels.,"Engineering proteins to construct self-assemblies is of crucial significance not only for understanding the sophisticated living systems but also for fabricating advanced materials with unexplored functions. However, due to the inherent chemical heterogeneity and structural complexity of the protein surface, designing complex protein assemblies in an anisotropic fashion remains challenging. Here, we describe a self-assembly approach to fabricating protein origami with a networklike structure by designing dual noncovalent interactions on the different positions of a single protein building block. With dimeric proteins as building blocks, 1D protein filaments were constructed by the designed metal coordination at key protein interfaces. Subsequently, the network superstructures were created by the cross-linking of the 1D protein filaments at branch point linkages through the second designed π-π stacking interactions. Notably, upon increasing the protein concentration, the formed protein networks convert into hydrogels with reversible, injectable, and self-healing properties, which have the ability to promote bone regeneration.

Herein, a super-elastic mineral hydrogel is developed with long-lasting moisture, based on dynamic physical crosslinking between hydrated calcium ion clusters and amide groups of polyacrylamide (PAM). The complex hydrogel exhibits a super stretchability of 13 600% at room temperature, and can maintain the super flexibility in a wide temperature range of -40-50 °C or for a long period of 28 days. Particularly, the soft material cannot be ignited under an open flame at 400-500 °C, because of coupling dual flame retardant mechanisms containing the endothermic effect of liquid water evaporation and the barrier effect of calcium mineral salt on oxygen.

Self-Healing Zwitterionic Microgels as a Versatile Platform for Malleable Cell Constructs and Injectable Therapies.,"Injectable and malleable hydrogels that combine excellent biocompatibility, physiological stability, and ease of use are highly desirable for biomedical applications. Here, a simple and scalable strategy is reported to make injectable and malleable zwitterionic polycarboxybetaine hydrogels, which are superhydrophilic, nonimmunogenic, and completely devoid of nonspecific interactions. When zwitterionic microgels are reconstructed, the combination of covalent crosslinking inside each microgel and supramolecular interactions between them gives the resulting zwitterionic injectable pellet (ZIP) constructs supportive moduli and tunable viscoelasticity. ZIP constructs can be lyophilized to a sterile powder that fully recovers its strength and elasticity upon rehydration, simplifying storage and formulation.

Supramolecular polymers constructed from macrocycle-based host-guest molecular recognition motifs.,"CONSPECTUS: Supramolecular polymers, fabricated via the combination of supramolecular chemistry and polymer science, are polymeric arrays of repeating units held together by reversible, relatively weak noncovalent interactions. The introduction of noncovalent interactions, such as hydrogen bonding, aromatic stacking interactions, metal coordination, and host-guest interactions, endows supramolecular polymers with unique stimuli responsiveness and self-adjusting abilities. As a result, diverse monomer structures have been designed and synthesized to construct various types of supramolecular polymers. By changing the noncovalent interaction types, numbers, or chemical structures of functional groups in these monomers, supramolecular polymeric materials can be prepared with tailored chemical and physical properties. In recent years, the interest in supramolecular polymers has been extended from the preparation of intriguing topological structures to the discoveries of potential applications as functional materials. Compared with traditional polymers, supramolecular polymers show some advantages in the fabrication of reversible or responsive materials. The development of supramolecular polymers also offers a platform to construct complex and sophisticated materials with a bottom-up approach. Macrocylic hosts, including crown ethers, cyclodextrins, calixarenes, cucurbiturils, and pillararenes, are the most commonly used building blocks in the fabrication of host-guest interaction-based supramolecular polymers. With the introduction of complementary guest molecules, macrocylic hosts demonstrate selective and stimuli-responsive host-guest complexation behaviors. By elaborate molecular design, the resultant supramolecular polymers can exhibit diverse structures based on the self-selectivity of host-guest interactions. The introduction of reversible host-guest interactions can further endow these supramolecular polymers with interesting and fascinating chemical/physical properties, including stimuli responsiveness, self-healing, and environmental adaptation. It has been reported that macrocycle-based supramolecular polymers can respond to pH change, photoirradition, anions, cations, temperature, and solvent. Macrocycle-based supramolecular polymers have been prepared in solution, in gel, and in the solid state. Furthermore, the solvent has a very important influence on the formation of these supramolecular polymers. Crown ether- and pillararene-based supramolecular polymers have mainly formed in organic solvents, such as chloroform, acetone, and acetonitrile, while cyclodextrin- and cucurbituril-based supramolecular polymerizations have been usually observed in aqueous solutions. For calixarenes, both organic solvents and water have been used as suitable media for supramolecular polymerization. With the development of supramolecular chemistry and polymer science, various methods, such as nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray techniques, electron microscopies, and theoretical calculation and computer simulation, have been applied for characterizing supramolecular polymers. The fabrication of macrocycle-based supramolecular polymers has become a currently hot research topic. In this Account, we summarize recent results in the investigation of supramolecular polymers constructed from macrocycle-based host-guest molecular recognition motifs. These supramolecular polymers are classified based on the different macrocycles used in them. Their monomer design, structure control, stimuli-responsiveness, and applications in various areas are discussed, and future research directions are proposed. It is expected that the development of supramolecular polymers will not only change the way we live and work but also exert significant influence on scientific research.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2014,Jul
The role of magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the bacterially induced calcium carbonate precipitation.,"Recently, magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONs) have been used to control and modify the characteristics of concrete and mortar. Concrete is one of the most used materials in the world; however, it is susceptible to cracking. Over recent years, a sustainable biotechnological approach has emerged as an alternative approach to conventional techniques to heal the concrete cracks by the incorporation of bacterial cells and nutrients into the concrete matrix. Once cracking occurs, CaCO<sub>3</sub> is induced and the crack is healed. Considering the positive effects of IONs on the concrete properties, the effect of these nanoparticles on bacterial growth and CaCO<sub>3</sub> biosynthesis needs to be evaluated for their possible application in bio self-healing concrete. In the present work, IONs were successfully synthesized and characterized using various techniques. The presence of IONs showed a significant effect on both bacterial growth and CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation. The highest bacterial growth was observed in the presence of 150 μg/mL IONs. The highest concentration of induced CaCO<sub>3</sub> (34.54 g/L) was achieved when the bacterial cells were immobilized with 300 μg/mL of IONs. This study provides new data and supports the possibility of using IONs as a new tool in designing the next generation of bio self-healing concrete.",Applied microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2018,Apr
Facile Construction of Superhydrophobic Surfaces by Coating Fluoroalkylsilane/Silica Composite on a Modified Hierarchical Structure of Wood.,"Constructing superhydrophobic surfaces by simple and low-cost methods remains a challenge in achieving the large-scale commercial application of superhydrophobic materials. Herein, a facile two-step process is presented to produce a self-healing superhydrophobic surface on wood to improve water and mildew resistance. In this process, the natural hierarchical structure of wood is firstly modified by sanding with sandpaper to obtain an appropriate micro/nano composite structure on the surface, then a fluoroalkylsilane/silica composite suspension is cast and dried on the wood surface to produce the superhydrophobic surface. Due to the full use of the natural hierarchical structure of wood, the whole process does not need complicated equipment or complex procedures to construct the micro/nano composite structure. Moreover, only a very low content of inorganic matter is needed to achieve superhydrophobicity. Encouragingly, the as-obtained superhydrophobic surface exhibits good resistance to abrasion. The superhydrophobicity can still be maintained after 45 abrasion cycles under the pressure of 3.5 KPa and this surface can spontaneously recover its superhydrophobicity at room temperature by self-healing upon damage. Moreover, its self-healing ability can be restored by spraying or casting the fluoroalkylsilane/silica composite suspension onto this surface to replenish the depleted healing agents. When used for wood protection, this superhydrophobic surface greatly improves the water and mildew resistance of wood, thereby prolonging the service life of wood-based materials.",Polymers,eng,2020,Apr
Programmable and contractile materials through cell encapsulation in fibrous hydrogel assemblies.,"The natural extracellular matrix (ECM) within tissues is physically contracted and remodeled by cells, allowing the collective shaping of functional tissue architectures. Synthetic materials that facilitate self-assembly similar to natural ECM are needed for cell culture, tissue engineering, and in vitro models of development and disease. To address this need, we develop fibrous hydrogel assemblies that are stabilized with photocrosslinking and display fiber density–dependent strain-responsive properties (strain stiffening and alignment). Encapsulated mesenchymal stromal cells locally contract low fiber density assemblies, resulting in macroscopic volumetric changes with increased cell densities and moduli. Because of properties such as shear-thinning and self-healing, assemblies can be processed into microtissues with aligned ECM deposition or through extrusion bioprinting and photopatterning to fabricate constructs with programmed shape changes due to cell contraction. These materials provide a synthetic approach to mimic features of natural ECM, which can now be processed for applications in biofabrication and tissue engineering.",Science advances,eng,2021,Nov
The Contribution of Elastic Wave NDT to the Characterization of Modern Cementitious Media.,"To mitigate autogenous shrinkage in cementitious materials and simultaneously preserve the material's mechanical performance, superabsorbent polymers and nanosilica are included in the mixture design. The use of the specific additives influences both the hydration process and the hardened microstructure, while autogenous healing of cracks can be stimulated. These three stages are monitored by means of non-destructive testing, showing the sensitivity of elastic waves to the occurring phenomena. Whereas the action of the superabsorbent polymers was evidenced by acoustic emission, the use of ultrasound revealed the differences in the developed microstructure and the self-healing of cracks by a comparison with more commonly performed mechanical tests. The ability of NDT to determine these various features renders it a promising measuring method for future characterization of innovative cementitious materials.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,May
Self-healing properties of recycled asphalt mixtures containing metal waste: An approach through microwave radiation heating.,"The concept of self-healing asphalt mixtures by bitumen temperature increase has been used by researchers to create an asphalt mixture with crack-healing properties by microwave or induction heating. Metals, normally steel wool fibers (SWF), are added to asphalt mixtures prepared with virgin materials to absorb and conduct thermal energy. Metal shavings, a waste material from the metal industry, could be used to replace SWF. In addition, reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) could be added to these mixtures to make a more sustainable road material. This research aimed to evaluate the effect of adding metal shavings and RAP on the properties of asphalt mixtures with crack-healing capabilities by microwave heating. The research indicates that metal shavings have an irregular shape with widths larger than typical SWF used with asphalt self-healing purposes. The general effect of adding metal shavings was an improvement in the crack-healing of asphalt mixtures, while adding RAP to mixtures with metal shavings reduced the healing. The average surface temperature of the asphalt samples after microwave heating was higher than temperatures obtained by induction heating, indicating that shavings are more efficient when mixtures are heated by microwave radiation. CT scan analysis showed that shavings uniformly distribute in the mixture, and the addition of metal shavings increases the air voids. Overall, it is concluded that asphalt mixtures with RAP and waste metal shavings have the potential of being crack-healed by microwave heating.",Journal of environmental management,eng,2018,May
Dynamic Iminoboronate-Based Boroxine Chemistry for the Design of Ambient Humidity-Sensitive Self-Healing Polymers.,"Developing intrinsic self-healing polymeric materials is of great interest nowadays to extend material lifetime and/or prevent the replacement of damaged pieces. Spontaneously humidity-sensitive healable polymer network built around dynamic covalent B-O bonds was templated by using iminoboronate-based boroxine derivatives. Taking advantage of the dynamic boroxine/boronic acid equilibrium and iminoboronate chemistry, it is possible to construct polymeric materials able to self-heal without requiring any energy-demanding external activation. Interestingly, this novel family of iminoboronate adduct-based materials can be readily produced by a relatively simple and straightforward synthesis between boronic acid and diamine-based compounds, paving the way to coatings that are self-healable at ambient humidity.","Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",eng,2017,May
Engineering High-Yield Biopolymer Secretion Creates an Extracellular Protein Matrix for Living Materials.,"The bacterial extracellular matrix forms autonomously, giving rise to complex material properties and multicellular behaviors. Synthetic matrix analogues can replicate these functions but require exogenously added material or have limited programmability. Here, we design a two-strain bacterial system that self-synthesizes and structures a synthetic extracellular matrix of proteins. We engineered <i>Caulobacter crescentus</i> to secrete an extracellular matrix protein composed of an elastin-like polypeptide (ELP) hydrogel fused to supercharged SpyCatcher [SC<sup>(-)</sup>]. This biopolymer was secreted at levels of 60 mg/liter, an unprecedented level of biomaterial secretion by a native type I secretion apparatus. The ELP domain was swapped with either a cross-linkable variant of ELP or a resilin-like polypeptide, demonstrating this system is flexible. The SC<sup>(-)</sup>-ELP matrix protein bound specifically and covalently to the cell surface of a <i>C. crescentus</i> strain that displays a high-density array of SpyTag (ST) peptides via its engineered surface layer. Our work develops protein design guidelines for type I secretion in <i>C. crescentus</i> and demonstrates the autonomous secretion and assembly of programmable extracellular protein matrices, offering a path forward toward the formation of cohesive engineered living materials.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Engineered living materials (ELM) aim to mimic characteristics of natural occurring systems, bringing the benefits of self-healing, synthesis, autonomous assembly, and responsiveness to traditional materials. Previous research has shown the potential of replicating the bacterial extracellular matrix (ECM) to mimic biofilms. However, these efforts require energy-intensive processing or have limited tunability. We propose a bacterially synthesized system that manipulates the protein content of the ECM, allowing for programmable interactions and autonomous material formation. To achieve this, we engineered a two-strain system to secrete a synthetic extracellular protein matrix (sEPM). This work is a step toward understanding the necessary parameters to engineering living cells to autonomously construct ELMs.",mSystems,eng,2021,Mar
Functional hepatocyte clusters on bioactive blend silk matrices towards generating bioartificial liver constructs.,"The creation of in vitro functional hepatic tissue simulating micro-environmental niche of native liver is a keen area of research due to its demand in bioartificial liver (BAL) and cell-based tissue engineering. Here, we investigated the potential of novel blend (BA) silk scaffold fabricated by blending mulberry (Bombyx mori, BM) silk fibroin with cell adhesion motif (RGD) rich non-mulberry (Antheraea assamensis, AA) silk fibroin, in generating a functional liver construct. Three-dimensional (3D) porous silk scaffolds (BM, AA and BA) were physico-chemically characterized and functionally evaluated using human hepatocarcinoma cells (HepG2) and primary neonatal rat hepatocytes. The growth and distribution of hepatocytes within the scaffolds were tracked by FESEM, alamar blue proliferation assay and live/dead staining. Hemocompatible BA scaffolds supported the formation of high density hepatocyte clusters, facilitating cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions. Blend scaffolds evinced enhanced liver-specific functions of cultured hepatocytes in terms of albumin synthesis, urea synthesis and cytochrome P450 enzyme activity over 21 days. Subcutaneous implantation of scaffolds demonstrated minimal macrophage infiltration in blend scaffolds. These findings substantiate that the integral property of blend (BA) scaffold offers a befitting environment by influencing spheroidal growth of hepatocytes with enhanced biological activity. Collectively, the present study provides a new 3D bio-matrix niche for growing functional liver cells that would have future prospects in BAL as well as regenerative medicine.",Acta biomaterialia,eng,2018,Feb
HClO/ClO<sup>-</sup>-Indicative Interpenetrating Polymer Network Hydrogels as Intelligent Bioactive Materials for Wound Healing.,"Wound healing is a complex biological process, and the use of wound dressings is an effective adjunct to promote skin repair or tissue healing due to the limitations of skin self-healing. In this study, we constructed interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels with HClO/ClO<sup>-</sup> indicative and biocompatible properties by combining sodium alginate (SA) and cross-linking <b>RhB-AC</b>. This hydrogel can also be used as a drug scaffold for controlled drug release. A significant fluorescence change was observed when hypochlorous acid was added to the hydrogel in vitro, which confirmed that the IPN hydrogel was able to indicate and consume a certain amount of hypochlorous acid. Subsequent cell culture and toxicity tests confirmed the good biocompatibility of the IPN hydrogel. When the hydrogel was used for wound healing in vivo, both the material itself and the hydrogel drug scaffold exhibited excellent wound healing effects. The present IPN hydrogels may be excellent candidates as hypochlorous acid consuming and biocompatible materials for wound dressing applications.",ACS applied bio materials,eng,2020,Jan
Electroactive injectable hydrogel based on oxidized sodium alginate and carboxymethyl chitosan for wound healing.,"Electroactive hydrogel is of great significance in restoring wound currents, promoting cell proliferation, and accelerating the wound healing process. However, the poor dispersity and underlying toxicity of electronic conductive fillers and high concentration of ionic conductors in traditional electroactive hydrogel limited its application in medical care. Herein, an electroactive oxidized sodium alginate/carboxymethyl chitosan/silver nanoparticles (OSA/CMCS/AgNPs) hydrogel was constructed with no additional conductive fillers or synthesized conductive polymers being added, in which the dynamic imine bonds were rapidly formed between aldehyde groups in OSA and amino groups in CMCS, and AgNPs were further in situ formed by UV irradiation. The electroactive hydrogel exhibited the injectable property, strong self-healing ability, excellent biocompatibility, and high antibacterial activities. Moreover, the electroactive hydrogel can significantly promote the proliferation of L929 cells under electrical stimulation. Furthermore, the electroactive hydrogel was proved to significantly accelerate the wound healing process in the full-thickness skin defect model, exhibiting anti-inflammation, promoting the fibroblasts proliferation, angiogenesis, and collagen deposition under electrical stimulation. In summary, the current work explored a novel strategy to construct the polysaccharides-based electroactive hydrogel with good biocompatibility and multi-functions, which is promising to be used in deep wound treatment.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2023,Mar
Complex multiphase organohydrogels with programmable mechanics toward adaptive soft-matter machines.,"Many biological organisms can tune their mechanical properties to adapt to environments in multistable modes, but the current synthetic materials, with bistable states, have a limited ability to alter mechanical stiffness. Here, we constructed programmable organohydrogels with multistable mechanical states by an on-demand modular assembly of noneutectic phase transition components inside microrganogel inclusions. The resultant multiphase organohydrogel exhibits precisely controllable thermo-induced stepwise switching (i.e., triple, quadruple, and quintuple switching) mechanics and a self-healing property. The organohydrogel was introduced into the design of soft-matter machines, yielding a soft gripper with adaptive grasping through stiffness matching with various objects under pneumatic-thermal hybrid actuation. Meanwhile, a programmable adhesion of octopus-inspired robotic tentacles on a wide range of surface morphologies was realized. These results demonstrated the applicability of these organohydrogels in lifelike soft robotics in unconstructed and human body environments.",Science advances,eng,2020,Jan
Rheological and ion-conductive properties of injectable and self-healing hydrogels based on xanthan gum and silk fibroin.,"The hydrogels with injectable and self-healing properties were prepared from xanthan gum (XG) and silk fibroin (SF) by using sodium trimetaphosphate (STMP) as crosslinker. A three-stage model of oscillation-shear-oscillation experiment was designed to mimic injection process and to observe destruction and regeneration of the hydrogels after shear. The XG3-SF-STMP hydrogels immediately recovered to original storage modulus of 80.6%-93.8% on removing shear. The hydrogels were 3D printed into the self-supporting constructions of hydrogel fibers with connected porous structures, and the XG3-SF-STMP hydrogel fibers exhibited smaller width than XG3-STMP. Oscillation rheological behavior indicated that XG3-SF-STMP hydrogels formed rapidly and exhibited more solid-like gel behavior than XG3-STMP. The hydrogel structures were destroyed under a strain (100%) larger than critical strain, but were rebuilt under a small strain (1%) with recovery ratio of 91.36-93.96% within 120 s, suggesting a self-healing property. Introduction of SF particles into XG3-STMP crosslinked networks improved stiffness and retained recoverability. Carboxyl and phosphate groups in the hydrogel networks are beneficial for XG3-SF-STMP hydrogels to absorb enough liquid electrolytes, leading to effective ionic conductivity. The ion-conductive hydrogel with injectable, self-healing, controlled release and non-cytotoxic properties possesses a promising prospect for tissue engineering and drug release application.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2020,Feb

The ratio of boronic acid and glucose functional groups is critical for hydrogel formation. In our system, polymers with 10-60% boronic acid, with the balance being glucose-modified, are favorable to form hydrogels. These hydrogels are shear-thinning and self-healing, recovering from shear-induced flow to a gel state within seconds. More importantly, these polymers displayed glucose-responsive release of an encapsulated model drug. The hydrogel reported here is an injectable and glucose-responsive hydrogel constructed from the complexation of boronic acid and glucose within a single component polymeric material.",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,eng,2016,Aug
Using the dynamic bond to access macroscopically responsive structurally dynamic polymers.,"New materials that have the ability to reversibly adapt to their environment and possess a wide range of responses ranging from self-healing to mechanical work are continually emerging. These adaptive systems have the potential to revolutionize technologies such as sensors and actuators, as well as numerous biomedical applications. We will describe the emergence of a new trend in the design of adaptive materials that involves the use of reversible chemistry (both non-covalent and covalent) to programme a response that originates at the most fundamental (molecular) level. Materials that make use of this approach - structurally dynamic polymers - produce macroscopic responses from a change in the material's molecular architecture (that is, the rearrangement or reorganization of the polymer components, or polymeric aggregates). This design approach requires careful selection of the reversible/dynamic bond used in the construction of the material to control its environmental responsiveness.",Nature materials,eng,2011,Jan
Construction of an antibacterial hydrogel based on diammonium glycyrrhizinate and gallic acid for bacterial- infected wound healing.,"The current antibacterial wound dressings with antibiotic substances or metal bactericidal agents may lead to severe multidrug resistance and poor biocompatibilities. Herein, we report an inherent antibacterial hydrogel constructed by only two naturally small molecules gallic acid (GA) and diammonium glycyrrhizinate (DG) for promoting Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)-infected wound healing. The resultant GAD hydrogel can be fabricated by co-assembly of these two materials through simple steps. Thanks to the incorporation of GA and DG, GAD hydrogel enabled a strong mechanical performance and great self-healing property with a sustained-release of drugs into skin wounds. Moreover, the cell viability assays showed that GAD hydrogel had good cytocompatibility by promoting cell proliferation and migration. In addition, GAD hydrogel had broad antibacterial efficiency against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Taken together, GAD hydrogel is a promising dressing to accelerate bacterial-infected wound healing through reconstructing an intact and thick epidermis without antibiotics or cytokines.","Colloids and surfaces.

Radical Covalent Organic Frameworks Associated with Liquid Na-K toward Dendrite-Free Alkali Metal Anodes.,"Liquid sodium-potassium (Na-K) alloy has the characteristics of high abundance, low redox potential, high capacity, and no dendrites, which has become an ideal alternative material for potassium/sodium metal anodes. However, the high surface tension of liquid sodium potassium alloy at room temperature makes it inconvenient in practical use. Here, the Na-K as reducing agent treats with hydrazone linkages of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and obtain the carbon-oxygen radical COFs (COR-Tf-DHzDM-COFs). The preparation method solves the problems that the preparation process of the traditional Na-K composite anode is complex and has high cost. The structures of the COR-Tf-DHzDM-COFs are characterized by X-ray diffraction （XRD), fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR), and solid-state NMR measurements. It is the first time that carbon-oxygen radical COFs from bulk COFs are constructed by one-step method and the operation is flexible, convenient, and high rate of quality, which is suitable for big production and widely used. The cycle stability of the composite Na-K anode is improved, which provides a new idea for the design of high-performance liquid metal anode.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",eng,2022,Sep
"Dynamic Semi IPNs with Duple Dynamic Linkers: Self-Healing, Reprocessing, Welding, and Shape Memory Behaviors.","Thermoset polymers show favorable material properties, while bringing about environmental pollution due to non-reprocessing and unrecyclable.

In-Situ X-ray Tomography Study of Cement Exposed to CO<sub>2</sub> Saturated Brine.,"For successful CO<sub>2</sub> storage in underground reservoirs, the potential problem of CO<sub>2</sub> leakage needs to be addressed. A profoundly improved understanding of the behavior of fractured cement under realistic subsurface conditions including elevated temperature, high pressure and the presence of CO<sub>2</sub> saturated brine is required. Here, we report in situ X-ray micro computed tomography (μ-CT) studies visualizing the microstructural changes upon exposure of cured Portland cement with an artificially engineered leakage path (cavity) to CO<sub>2</sub> saturated brine at high pressure. Carbonation of the bulk cement, self-healing of the leakage path in the cement specimen, and leaching of CaCO<sub>3</sub> were thus directly observed. The precipitation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>, which is of key importance as a possible healing mechanism of fractured cement, was found to be enhanced in confined regions having limited access to CO<sub>2</sub>. For the first time, the growth kinetics of CaCO<sub>3</sub> under more realistic well conditions have thus been estimated quantitatively.

Self-assembled small molecule natural product gel for drug delivery: a breakthrough in new application of small molecule natural products.,"Natural products, as a gift of nature to humanity, have long been used as drugs or pharmacological actives to help people cure various diseases. Yet we still know comparatively little about their ability to be materials. In recent years, some small molecule natural products isolated from traditional Chinese medicines have been found to have new features, namely, self-assembly to form gels (<i>i.e</i>., natural product gels, NPG). However, the application development of these natural products is seriously lacking, which greatly weakens their practical value and delays the maturity of the field. Here, a series of self-assembled triterpenoid natural products are used as materials (gel scaffolds) to construct drug delivery systems. Surprisingly, these NPG not only exhibit the excellent self-healing, controlled gelation, good safety and sustained release, but also achieve synergistic treatment of tumors through bioactive natural products. Compared with non-bioactive gel scaffolds, NPG scaffolds show great advantages in tumor therapy, including optimal tumor inhibition, preferable health, better body recovery, stronger immune function, less toxic side effects and longer survival.

"An injectable, self-healable, antibacterial, and pro-healing oxidized pullulan polysaccharide/carboxymethyl chitosan hydrogel for early protection of open abdominal wounds.","Open abdomen (OA) is an effective method for treating critical abdominal conditions such as severe abdominal infections. The temporary abdominal closure (TAC) technique is often used to temporarily restore the physiological environment of the abdominal cavity and maintain the homeostatic balance of the abdominal cavity. However, most of the common TAC materials available today lack bio-responsiveness, tend to abrade the intestinal canal, and lead to delayed tissue healing of the wound. Hydrogels could mimic the extracellular matrix and have shown significant potential in life science fields such as tissue regeneration, wound repair, and controlled drug release. In this study, a composite hydrogel scaffold was constructed by the Schiff base reaction of oxidized pullulan polysaccharide with carboxymethyl chitosan. The hydrogel exhibited excellent self-healing, cellular biocompatibility, and antibacterial and anti-inflammatory abilities, and in experiments it reduced secondary damage caused by friction between tissue and patch, thereby preventing serious complications such as intestinal fistula, promoted M1-M2 polarization of macrophages, reduced the inflammatory response, regulated the inflammatory microenvironment in vivo, promoted angiogenesis and granulation tissue regeneration, and accelerated wound healing.

Polysaccharide-based recoverable double-network hydrogel with high strength and self-healing properties.,"Polysaccharide-based hydrogels (PSBHs) have received significant attention for numerous bio-applications due to their biocompatibility and non-immunogenic performance. However, the construction of PSBH with superior mechanical properties by a simple method is rarely adequately researched. This study focuses on the construction of a novel PSBH with superior mechanical and recoverable properties by integrating the synergistic and complementary interactions of covalent bond-associated oxidized sodium alginate (SA-CHO) gel and hydrogen bond-associated agarose (Aga) gel. With the synergy and complementarity of the SA-CHO and Aga networks, the hydrogel exhibited 17 and 15 times (20 and 9 times) greater compressive stress and modulus, respectively, compared with the SA-CHO gel (Aga gel).

Nanoengineered shear-thinning and bioprintable hydrogel as a versatile platform for biomedical applications.,"The development of bioinks based on shear-thinning and self-healing hydrogels has recently attracted significant attention for constructing complex three-dimensional physiological microenvironments. For extrusion-based bioprinting, it is challenging to provide high structural reliability and resolution of printed structures while protecting cells from shear forces during printing. Herein, we present shear-thinning and printable hydrogels based on silicate nanomaterials, laponite (LA), and glycosaminoglycan nanoparticles (GAGNPs) for bioprinting applications. Nanocomposite hydrogels (GLgels) were rapidly formed within seconds due to the interactions between the negatively charged groups of GAGNPs and the edges of LA. The shear-thinning behavior of the hydrogel protected encapsulated cells from aggressive shear stresses during bioprinting. The bioinks could be printed straightforwardly into shape-persistent and free-standing structures with high aspect ratios. Rheological studies demonstrated fast recovery of GLgels over multiple strain cycles. In vitro studies confirmed the ability of GLgels to support cell growth, proliferation, and spreading. In vitro osteogenic differentiation of pre-osteoblasts murine bone marrow stromal cells encapsulated inside the GLgels was also demonstrated through evaluation of ALP activity and calcium deposition. The subcutaneous implantation of the GLgel in rats confirmed its in vivo biocompatibility and biodegradability. The engineered shear-thinning hydrogel with osteoinductive characteristics can be used as a new bioink for 3D printing of constructs for bone tissue engineering applications.",Biomaterials,eng,2021,Jan
Bioconductive 3D nano-composite constructs with tunable elasticity to initiate stem cell growth and induce bone mineralization.,"Bioactive 3D composites play an important role in advanced biomaterial design to provide molecular coupling and improve integrity with the cellular environment of the native bone. In the present study, a hybrid lyophilized polymer composite blend of anionic charged sodium salt of carboxymethyl chitin and gelatin (CMChNa-GEL) reinforced with nano-rod agglomerated hydroxyapatite (nHA) has been developed with enhanced biocompatibility and tunable elasticity. The scaffolds have an open, uniform and interconnected porous structure with an average pore diameter of 157±30μm and 89.47+0.03% with four dimensional X-ray. The aspect ratio of ellipsoidal pores decrease from 4.4 to 1.2 with increase in gelatin concentration; and from 2.14 to 1.93 with decrease in gelling temperature. The samples were resilient with elastic stain at 1.2MPa of stress also decreased from 0.33 to 0.23 with increase in gelatin concentration. The crosslinker HMDI (hexamethylene diisocyanate) yielded more resilient samples at 1.2MPa in comparison to glutaraldehyde. Increased crosslinking time from 2 to 4h in continuous compression cycle show no improvement in maximum elastic stain of 1.2MPa stress. This surface elasticity of the scaffold enables the capacity of these materials for adherent self renewal and cultivation of the NTERA-2 cL.D1 (NT2/D1), pluripotent embryonal carcinoma cell with biomechanical surface, as is shown here. Proliferation with MG-63, ALP activity and Alizarin red mineralization assay on optimized scaffold demonstrated ***p<0.001 between different time points thus showing its potential for bone healing. In pre-clinical study histological bone response of the scaffold construct displayed improved activity of bone regeneration in comparison to self healing of control groups (sham) up to week 07 after implantation in rabbit tibia critical-size defect. Therefore, this nHA-CMChNa-GEL scaffold composite exhibits inherent and efficient physicochemical, mechanical and biological characteristics based on gel concentrations, gelatin mixing and gelling temperature thus points to creating bioactive 3D scaffolds with tunable elasticity for orthopedic applications.","Materials science & engineering.

In this study, we have developed hybrid constructs using polycaprolactone (PCL) and decellularized meniscus extracellular matrix (DMECM) surface modified by gelatin (G), hyaluronic acid (HU) and selenium (Se) nanoparticles (PCL/DMECM/G/HU/Se), following by the cross-linking of the bio-polymeric surface. Material characterization has been performed on the fabricated scaffold using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, swelling and degradation analyses, and mechanical tests. In Vitro, investigations have been conducted by C28/I2 human chondrocyte culture into the scaffold and evaluated the cytotoxicity and cell/scaffold interaction. For the in vivo study, the scaffolds were transplanted into the defect sites of female New Zealand white rabbits. Good regeneration was observed after two months. We have concluded that the designed PCL/DMECM/G/HU construct can be a promising candidate as a meniscus tissue engineering scaffold to facilitate healing.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2022,Jul
EGCG-crosslinked carboxymethyl chitosan-based hydrogels with inherent desired functions for full-thickness skin wound healing.,"Hydrogel wound dressings have attracted intense and increasing interest for their extracellular matrix like properties and bioactive material delivery ability. Various functional hydrogels loaded with metals (and their oxides), antibiotics and anti-inflammatory agents have been prepared to realize antioxidant, bactericidal and anti-inflammatory effects, accelerating wound healing. Nevertheless, it is still a big challenge to facilely fabricate hydrogel wound dressings with inherent desirable properties to promote wound healing and avoid some drawbacks such as toxicity of metals and drug resistance. Herein, we facilely prepared a series of (-)-epigallocatechin-3-<i>O</i>-gallate (EGCG)-crosslinked carboxymethyl chitosan-based hydrogels (EP gels) with inherent antioxidant, bactericidal and adhesive properties. Gluconate-terminated polyethylene glycol (PEG-glu) was introduced into gel networks to enhance the mechanical properties. The hydrogels are constructed <i>via</i> borate ester crosslinking between phenylboronic acid (PBA) groups of PBA-grafted carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS-PBA) and diol groups of EGCG and PEG-glu. The hydrogels exhibited excellent self-healing properties, desirable mechanical and adhesive strength, free radical scavenging capability and outstanding bactericidal ability against <i>S. aureus</i> and <i>E. coli</i>. In the subsequent full-thickness skin defect model of mice, EP1 gel could promote the proliferation and remodeling process such as the regeneration of epidermis, dermis, and skin appendages, deposition of collagen, and upregulation of the VEGF level, thereby accelerating the healing of damaged skin. Overall, we facilely prepared polysaccharide-based hydrogels with inherent desirable properties as promising dressings for wound repair.",Journal of materials chemistry. B,eng,2022,May
Configurational Entropy Regulation in Polyolefin Elastomer/Paraffin Wax Vitrimers by Thermally Responsive Liquid-Solid Transition for Force Storage.,"The work output of shape memory polymers during shape shifting is desired for practical application as actuators. Herein, a polyolefin elastomer (POE) and paraffin wax (PW) are co-cross-linked by dynamic boronic ester bonds to enhance the network elasticity and the stress transfer between the two phases, endowing high force storage capacity to the prepared vitrimers. Depending on the phase of PW, one-way force storage is realized by programming at a low temperature (25 °C), owing to which solid PW can promote the locking of POE chains in a low-entropy state, while reversible force storage can be realized by programming at a high temperature (75 °C), owing to which the relaxation of chains facilitated by liquid PW can promote the construction of a stable structure. Based on one-way force storage, a weight-lifting machine with a weight of 20 mg prestrained at 25 °C can lift a 100 g weight, showing a lifting ratio of no less than 5000, with a high work output of 0.98 J/g. A high-temperature alarm can be triggered at varied temperatures (43-56 °C) through controlled force release by adjusting the PW content and programmed prestrains. Based on the reversible force storage, crawling robots and artificial muscles with a work output of 0.025 J/g are demonstrated. The dynamic cross-linking network also confers mold-free self-healing capability to POE/PW vitrimers, and the repair efficiency is enhanced compared with the POE vitrimer due to the improved POE chain motion by liquid PW. The realized one-way and reversible force storage and self-healing by POE/PW vitrimers pave the way for the application of SMPs in the fields of soft robotic actuators.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,Mar
Viscoelastic Hydrogel Microfibers Exploiting Cucurbit[8]uril Host-Guest Chemistry and Microfluidics.,"Fiber-shaped soft constructs are indispensable building blocks for various 3D functional objects such as hierarchical structures within the human body. The design and fabrication of such hierarchically structured soft materials, however, are often challenged by the trade-offs between stiffness, toughness, and continuous production. Here, we describe a microfluidic platform to continuously fabricate double network hydrogel microfibers with tunable structural, chemical, and mechanical features. Construction of the double network microfibers is accomplished through the incorporation of dynamic cucurbit[<i>n</i>]uril host-guest interactions, as energy dissipation moieties, within an agar-based brittle network. These microfibers exhibit an increase in fracture stress, stretchability, and toughness by 2-3 orders of magnitude compared to the pristine agar network, while simultaneously gaining recoverable hysteretic energy dissipation without sacrificing mechanical strength. This strategy of integrating a wide range of dynamic interactions with the breadth of natural resources could be used in the preparation of functional hydrogels, providing a versatile approach toward the continuous fabrication of soft materials with programmable functions.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Apr
Self-Healing Label Materials Based on Photo-Cross-Linkable Polymeric Films with Dynamic Surface Structures.,"Spatially controlling the evolution of surface structures may provide an effective strategy for patterning surface roughness and facilitating the construction of various functional surfaces. In this study, we report a photo-cross-linkable polymeric film with dynamic surface micro/nanostructures. The surface structures of the un-cross-linked regions can be eliminated under saturated humidity, which can be utilized to create patterned roughness on the film. One potential application of this patternable platform is as a ""smart"" label material for graphical symbols. Various graphical symbols can be programmed onto this film by partially erasing its surface roughness, enabling visibility due to the difference in light scattering between different areas of the film. When a thus-prepared label was blurred by mechanical scratches, it could be healed under saturated humidity, and its original readability could be fully restored. Furthermore, the patterned rough surface created using our approach can also be very useful in many other research fields, such as surface wettability and cell behavior manipulation.",ACS nano,eng,2018,Aug
Availability of Environmental Iron Influences the Performance of Biological Adhesives Produced by Blue Mussels.,"Animals incorporate metals within the materials they manufacture, such as protective armor and teeth. Iron is an element used for adding strength and self-healing properties to load-bearing materials. Incorporation of iron is found beyond hard, brittle materials, even within the soft adhesive produced by marine mussels. Such findings suggest that the bioavailability of iron may have an influence on the properties of a biological material. Experiments were conducted using live mussels in which seawater iron levels were deficient, normal, or in excess of typical concentrations. The weakest adhesive strengths were produced in iron-deficient waters. Increasing seawater iron brought about more robust bonding. Changes in strengths correlated with varied adhesive morphology, color, and microstructural features, likely a result of variations in the degree of iron-induced protein cross-linking. This study provides the first whole animal scale data on how the manipulation of bioavailable iron influences the performance of a biological material. Changing ocean chemistries will alter the iron bioavailability when a decrease in pH shifts elemental speciation from particulate to dissolved, hindering the ability of filtering organisms to capture nutrients. These results show future implications of changing ocean chemistry as well as of the resulting abilities of marine organisms to construct essential materials.",Environmental science & technology,eng,2020,Aug
"Polysiloxane-Based Autonomic Self-Healing Elastomers Obtained through Dynamic Boronic Ester Bonds Prepared by Thiol-Ene ""Click"" Chemistry.","Cross-linked silicone elastomers constructed with dynamic-covalent boronic esters are first synthesized by photoinitiated radical thiol-ene ""click"" chemistry. The resultant samples can be cut with a sharp knife into two pieces and then healed via the reversibility of the boronic ester cross-linkages to restore the original silicone sample within 30 min. Regulation of luminescent properties is achieved by incorporating organic dye into the elastomers through a ""one-pot"" thiol-ene reaction. The proposed synthesis procedure demonstrates a new strategy to produce boronic acid silicone materials capable of self-healing without external forces.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2016,Jul
Stem cell-laden hydrogel bioink for generation of high resolution and fidelity engineered tissues with complex geometries.,"Recently, 3D bioprinting has been explored as a promising technology for biomedical applications with the potential to create complex structures with precise features. Cell encapsulated hydrogels composed of materials such as gelatin, collagen, hyaluronic acid, alginate and polyethylene glycol have been widely used as bioinks for 3D bioprinting. However, since most hydrogel-based bioinks may not allow rapid stabilization immediately after 3D bioprinting, achieving high resolution and fidelity to the intended architecture is a common challenge in 3D bioprinting of hydrogels. In this study, we have utilized shear-thinning and self-healing ionically crosslinked oxidized and methacrylated alginates (OMAs) as a bioink, which can be rapidly gelled by its self-healing property after bioprinting and further stabilized via secondary crosslinking. It was successfully demonstrated that stem cell-laden calcium-crosslinked OMA hydrogels can be bioprinted into complicated 3D tissue structures with both high resolution and fidelity. Additional photocrosslinking enables long-term culture of 3D bioprinted constructs for formation of functional tissue by differentiation of encapsulated human mesenchymal stem cells.",Bioactive materials,eng,2022,Sep
"Temperature-Responsive, Manipulable Cavitary Hydrogel Containers by Macroscopic Spatial Surface-Interior Separation.","Synthetic macroscopic materials transforming from bulk solid or semisolid to a closed structure with inner cavities and distinct outer and inner microstructures are rarely reported. Here, we report an <i>in situ</i> method for directing spatial surface-interior separation from bulk dynamic hydrogels to closed three-dimensional (3D) hydrogel containers with inner cavities <i>via</i> constructing a competitively cross-linking gradient within dynamic hydrogels. The initial cross-linking of phenylboronic acid/catechol complexes is disrupted by stronger ferric ions/catechol associations, generating gradually weakened cross-linking from the outside to the inside. Both stronger cross-linking in the outer shells and sequentially weaker cross-linked interior generated during swelling closed the hydrogel container with a tunable dense outer shell, fluffy inner layer, and cavities in the core. Cellulose nanocrystals could be used to significantly improve the spatial distinction of gradient cross-linking within hydrogels, leading to an even denser outer shell with tunable shell thickness. Moreover, cavitary hydrogel containers with diverse shapes can be programmed by designing the initial shapes of dynamic hydrogels and macroscopic assembly of individual dynamic hydrogels based on their self-healing capability after subsequent surface-interior separation. These cavitary hydrogel containers demonstrate thermal-responsive gate systems with unique sustained release at higher temperature and potential reaction containers for oxygen generation on demand. This facile spatial surface-interior separation strategy for fabricating closed cavity systems has great potential for various applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Jan
Fabrication of Highly Thermally Resistant and Self-Healing Polysiloxane Elastomers by Constructing Covalent and Reversible Networks.,"The fabrication of self-healing elastomers with high thermal stability for use in extreme thermal conditions such as aerospace remains a major challenge. A strategy for preparing self-healing elastomers with stable covalent bonds and dynamic metal-ligand coordination interactions as crosslinking sites in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is proposed. The added Fe (III) not only serves as the dynamic crosslinking point at room temperature which is crucial for self-healing performance, but also plays a role as free radical scavenging agent at high temperatures. The results show that the PDMS elastomers possessed an initial thermal degradation temperature over 380 °C and a room temperature self-healing efficiency as high as 65.7%. Moreover, the char residue at 800 °C of PDMS elastomer reaches 7.19% in nitrogen atmosphere, and up to 14.02% in air atmosphere by doping a small amount (i.e., 0.3 wt%) of Fe (III), which is remarkable for the self-healing elastomers that contain weak and dynamic bonds with relatively poor thermal stability. This study provides an insight into designing self-healing PDMS-based materials that can be targeted for use as high-temperature thermal protection coatings.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2023,Sep
Supramolecular medical antibacterial tissue adhesive prepared based on natural small molecules.,"In the field of biomedicine, tissue bio-adhesives require the use of polymer materials with integrated functions to meet changing practical applications. However, the currently available tissue glues cannot balance mechanical properties and biocompatibility. Inspired by the conversion of lipoic acid from small molecular biological sources into high-performance supramolecular polymeric materials, thioctic acid (TA) was modified and polyethylene glycol diacrylate (PEGDA) was introduced. Successfully constructed a dry gel with antibacterial effect and promote infection for wound regeneration. The prepared modified lipoic acid is mixed with PEGDA, melted under mild heating and self-assembled, and then directly extruded on both sides of the wound. It quickly cures at 37 °C and firmly adheres to both sides of the wound. The material exhibits good processability and rapid self-healing ability due to the cross-linked structure of the internal disulfide bonds and thioether bonds. In addition, the characteristics of TA make the prepared xerogels have good tissue adhesion and good antibacterial properties. This work proposes an innovative material with mechanical strength and biocompatible tissue glue, which provides broad prospects for application in wound treatment.",Biomaterials science,eng,2020,Nov
Superstructure Formation and Topological Evolution Achieved by Self-Organization of a Highly Adaptive Dynamer.,"The adaptive property of supramolecular building blocks facilitates noncovalent synthesis of soft materials. While it is still a challenging task, fine-tuning and precise control over topological nanostructures constructed from the self-assembly of low-molecular-weight building blocks are an important research direction to investigate the structure-property relationship. Herein, we report controlled self-assembly evolution of a low-molecular-weight building block bearing cholesterol and naphthalene-dicarboximide moieties, showing ultrasensitivity to solvent polarity. In low-polarity solvents (<4), it could form an M-type fiber-constituted organogel (supergel) with high solvent content, columnar molecular packing, and self-healing property. Highly polar solvents (>7.8) favor the formation of P-type helical nanostructures terminated by nanotoroids, having lamellar molecular packing. With a further increase in solvent polarity (up to 9.6), unilamellar and multilamellar vesicles were generated, which could undergo an aggregation-induced fusion process to form branched nanotubes tuned by the concentration. Self-attractive interactions between aggregates were found to be responsible for the formation of superstructures including helix-nanotoroid junctions as well as membrane-fused nanotubes.",ACS nano,eng,2016,Feb
Effects of Microwave Heating and Long-Term Aging on the Rheological and Chemical Properties of Recovered Bitumen.,"Microwave heating of asphalt pavement is a promising technique to reduce the maintenance and increase the service life of materials through self-healing of cracks. Previous studies have shown that microwave heating technology at high temperatures could damage the bitumen of asphalt mixture, which is an unwanted effect of the crack-healing technique. In this study, the effects of microwave heating and long-term aging on the rheological and chemical properties of recovered bitumen were quantified using a frequency sweep test and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometry analysis, respectively. The main results indicate that microwave heating has no significant effect on the aging performance of G* and δ for aged asphalt mixtures. However, for newer bitumens, the rheological properties G* and δ show minor changes after microwave heating was applied. Overall, this study confirms that microwave heating is a potential alternative for maintenance of asphalt pavements, without severely affecting the rheological and chemical properties of bitumen.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Dec
Electrochemical Ring-Opening Dicarboxylation of Strained Carbon-Carbon Single Bonds with CO<sub>2</sub>: Facile Synthesis of Diacids and Derivatization into Polyesters.,"Diacids are important monomers in the polymer industry to construct valuable materials. Dicarboxylation of unsaturated bonds, such as alkenes and alkynes, with CO<sub>2</sub> has been demonstrated as a promising synthetic method. However, dicarboxylation of C─C single bonds with CO<sub>2</sub> has rarely been investigated. Herein we report a novel electrochemical ring-opening dicarboxylation of C─C single bonds in strained rings with CO<sub>2</sub>. Structurally diverse glutaric acid and adipic acid derivatives were synthesized from substituted cyclopropanes and cyclobutanes in moderate to high yields. In contrast to oxidative ring openings, this is also the first realization of an electroreductive ring-opening reaction of strained rings, including commercialized ones. Control experiments suggested that radical anions and carbanions might be the key intermediates in this reaction. Moreover, this process features high step and atom economy, mild reaction conditions (1 atm, room temperature), good chemoselectivity and functional group tolerance, low electrolyte concentration, and easy derivatization of the products. Furthermore, we conducted polymerization of the corresponding diesters with diols to obtain a potential UV-shielding material with a self-healing function and a fluorine-containing polyester, whose performance tests showed promising applications.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,eng,2022,Feb
3D printed colloidal biomaterials based on photo-reactive gelatin nanoparticles.,"Biomaterials-based strategies have shown great promise for tissue regeneration. 3D printing technologies can deliver unprecedented control over architecture and properties of biomaterial constructs when combined with innovative material design strategies. Colloidal gels made of polymeric nanoparticles are attractive injectable and self-healing systems, but their use as bio-inks for extrusion-based printing is largely unexplored. Here, we report 3D printing of novel biomaterial constructs with shape memory behavior using photo-reactive gelatin nanoparticles as colloidal building blocks. These nanoparticles are stabilized with intraparticle covalent crosslinks, and also contain pendant methacryloyl groups as photo-reactive moieties. While non-covalent interactions between nanoparticles enable formation of colloidal gel inks that are printable at room temperature, UV-induced covalent interparticle crosslinks based on methacryloyl moieties significantly enhance mechanical properties of printed constructs. Additionally, the UV crosslinking modality enables remarkable control over swelling, degradation, and biomolecule release behavior of 3D constructs. Finally, by exploiting the mechanical properties of colloidal biomaterials after UV crosslinking, 3D constructs can be designed with shape memory properties, returning to their original programmed geometry upon re-hydration. Accordingly, these novel colloidal inks exhibit great potential to serve as bio-inks for 3D printing of biomaterials with shape-morphing features for a wide range of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications.",Biomaterials,eng,2021,Jul
Study on the Performance of Recycled Coarse and Fine Aggregates as Microbial Carriers Applied to Self-Healing Concrete.,"The contradiction between the scarcity of natural resources and the demand for construction materials has given rise to the application of recycled aggregates. Microbial self-healing concrete (SHC) is a clean and smart material, and its carrier has a great influence on repair performance. In this paper, recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) and recycled fine aggregate (RFA) were used as carriers, and their different repair effects over time were intensively investigated. The results showed that the RCA carrier had a better repair effect compared with that of RFA, and the maximum healing width could reach 0.27 mm by 28 day. The microbial repair efficiency was significantly influenced by the distribution of old mortar, with the RFA specimen having a small volume and wide distribution of repair products, while the RCA repair showed a centralized tendency. In addition, SEM, MIP and XRD characterization were used to analyze the repair mechanism. The time-dependent repair model was developed, and the applicability of the model for concrete enhancement under microbial repair was verified through experimental results. The research results could promote industrial applications by giving intelligent and green properties to recycled aggregates.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2023,Mar
Preparation of Boron Nitride Nanoplatelets via Amino Acid Assisted Ball Milling: Towards Thermal Conductivity Application.,"Hexagonal boron nitride nanoplatelets (BNNPs) have attracted widespread attention due to their unique physical properties and their peeling from the base material. Mechanical exfoliation is a simple, scalable approach to produce single-layer or few-layer BNNPs. In this work, two amino acid grafted boron nitride nanoplatelets, Lys@BNNP and Glu@BNNP, were successfully prepared via ball milling of h-BN with L-Lysine and L-Glutamic acid, respectively. It was found that the dispersion state of Lys@BNNP and Glu@BNNP in water had been effectively stabilized due to the introduction of amino acid moieties which contained a hydrophilic carboxyl group. PVA hydrogel composites with Lys@BNNP and Glu@BNNP as functional fillers were constructed and extensively studied. With 11.3 wt% Lys@BNNP incorporated, the thermal conductivity of Lys@BNNP/PVA hydrogel composite was up to 0.91 W m<sup>-1</sup>K<sup>-1</sup>, increased by 78%, comparing to the neat PVA hydrogel. Meanwhile, the mechanical and self-healing properties of the composites were simultaneously largely enhanced.","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Aug
Microgel-Extracellular Matrix Composite Support for the Embedded 3D Printing of Human Neural Constructs.,"The embedded 3D printing of cells inside a granular support medium has emerged in the past decade as a powerful approach for the freeform biofabrication of soft tissue constructs. However, granular gel formulations have been restricted to a limited number of biomaterials that allow for the cost-effective generation of large amounts of hydrogel microparticles. Therefore, granular gel support media have generally lacked the cell-adhesive and cell-instructive functions found in the native extracellular matrix (ECM). To address this, a methodology has been developed for the generation of self-healing annealable particle-extracellular matrix (SHAPE) composites. SHAPE composites consist of a granular phase (microgels) and a continuous phase (viscous ECM solution) that, together, allow for both programmable high-fidelity printing and an adjustable biofunctional extracellular environment. This work describes how the developed methodology can be utilized for the precise biofabrication of human neural constructs. First, alginate microparticles, which serve as the granular component in the SHAPE composites, are fabricated and combined with a collagen-based continuous component. Then, human neural stem cells are printed inside the support material, followed by the annealing of the support. The printed constructs can be maintained for weeks to allow the differentiation of the printed cells into neurons. Simultaneously, the collagen continuous phase allows for axonal outgrowth and the interconnection of regions. Finally, this works provides information on how to perform live-cell fluorescence imaging and immunocytochemistry to characterize the 3D-printed human neural constructs.",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,eng,2023,May
Superhydrophobic and Self-Healing Mg-Al Layered Double Hydroxide/Silane Composite Coatings on the Mg Alloy Surface with a Long-Term Anti-corrosion Lifetime.,"Both a superhydrophobic structure and layered double hydroxide (LDH) coating were effective to improve the corrosion resistance of alloys. In this study, a superhydrophobic composite coating based on LDHs was constructed on Mg alloy by laser treatment, in situ growth of Mg-Al LDHs, and modification with octadecyl-trimethoxy-silane (OTS). The so-obtained composite coating was coded as L-LDHs-OTS, where L stands for laser treatment. Results showed that the L-LDHs-OTS composite coating presented the best anti-corrosion performance and the corrosion current density was reduced by about 5 orders of magnitude compared with that of the Mg alloy substrate. The excellent corrosion resistance was related to the superhydrophobicity of the composite coating, the compactness and ion-exchange capacity of the LDH layer, and the dense Si-O-Si network within the OTS layer. Moreover, the L-LDHs-OTS composite coating was still effective after 20 days of immersion tests, showing good long-term corrosion resistance due to the existence of hydrophobicity of the composite coating and the self-healing ability of LDHs.",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,eng,2021,Jul
"Design of Slidable Polymer Networks: A Rational Strategy to Stretchable, Rapid Self-Healing Hydrogel Electrolytes for Flexible Supercapacitors.","Hydrogel electrolytes are of particular interest in the fabrication of flexible supercapacitors that are able to withstand deformation and physical damage. Nevertheless, there still exists a huge space in the design of hydrogel electrolytes with comprehensive performances including high processability, conductivity, mechanical strength, and self-healability. Herein, a slidable polymer network is constructed through the cross-linking reaction among commercially available polyethyleneimine (PEI), polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), and 4-formylphenylboronic acid (Bn) to generate PEI-PVA-Bn hydrogels, which have high adaptability to various electrolytes such as LiCl, NaCl, KCl, and ionic liquids. The as formed hydrogel electrolytes not only show excellent mechanical property (elongation at break up to 1223%, strength of 34.6 kPa) and self-healability (highest strain self-healing efficiency reaches 94.3% within 2 min) but also exhibit high conductivity (up to 21.49 mS cm<sup>-1</sup>). Flexible supercapacitors constructed by sandwiching the PEI-PVA-Bn-LiCl hydrogel electrolyte between two multiwalled carbon nanotube electrodes demonstrate a broadened operating potential window of 1.4 V, specific capacitance of 16.7 mF cm<sup>-2</sup>, high cycling stability up to 10 000 charge/discharge cycles, and excellent mechanical stability.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,May
Flexible thermal conductive Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@siloxane composite with rapid self-healing property based on carboxyl-amine dynamic reversible bonds.,"Thermal interface materials (TIMs) are one of the efficacious ways to alleviate the heat accumulation problem of microelectronics devices. However, conventional TIMs based on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) always suffer from mechanical damage, leading to shortened service life or loss of thermal conductivity. In this work, we fabricated a high-thermal conductivity and fast self-healable Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@siloxane composite by hydrosilylation reaction. The siloxane matrix consisted of thermosetting silicone rubber matrix (SR) and heat reversibility matrix (SCNR); the SR was synthesized <i>via</i> hydrosilylation between silicon hydrogen bond and vinyl, the SCNR was fabricated by thermal-curing between amino and carboxyl functionalized PDMS. Different sized spherical Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> fillers were introduced into the SR/SCNR matrix system to construct the Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>@SR/SCNR composites. By adjusting the ratio of SR/SCNR, the obtained composites can achieve flexibility, self-healing and high filling simultaneously. It is notable that the self-healing efficiency of the composite is high, up to 95.6% within 3 minutes with 6.7 wt% mass ratio of SCNR/SR; these fast self-healing behaviors benefit from the assistance of thermal diffusion by 3D heat conduction pathways on the rearrangement of the dynamic cross-linked network. The resultant composites also exhibited the optimal thermal conductivity of 5.85 W mK<sup>-1</sup>.

Development of an Adhesive Gel System for Changing the Structure and Properties of Its Adhesive Joint via Reactions with Amine Molecules after Adhesion.,"Adhesive gel systems are attracting increasing interest from researchers to use gel materials for artificial biomaterials and engineering materials. Humans, among other living beings, eat foods, get nutrients from them, and use these nutrients to grow up day by day. The shapes and characteristics of their bodies change depending on the nutrients they get. This research develops an adhesive gel system that the chemical structure of the adhesive joint and their properties can be changed and regulated after adhesion, like the growth of living beings. The adhesive joint, which is constructed using a linear polymer comprising a cyclic trithiocarbonate monomer and acrylamide, developed in this research reacts with amines and forms chemical structures depending on amines.

Optimization of Bio-Foamed Concrete Brick Strength via Bacteria Based Self-Healing and Bio-Sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub>.,"This research aimed to optimize the compressive strength of bio-foamed concrete brick (B-FCB) via a combination of the natural sequestration of CO<sub>2</sub> and the bio-reaction of <i>B. tequilensis</i> enzymes. The experiments were guided by two optimization methods, namely, 2<sup>k</sup> factorial and response surface methodology (RSM). The 2<sup>k</sup> factorial analysis was carried out to screen the important factors; then, RSM analysis was performed to optimize the compressive strength of B-FCB. Four factors, namely, density (D), <i>B. tequilensis</i> concentration (B), temperature (T), and CO<sub>2</sub> concentration, were selectively varied during the study. The optimum compressive strength of B-FCB was 8.22 MPa, as deduced from the following conditions: 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, 3 × 10<sup>7</sup> cell/mL of B, 27 °C of T and 1800 kg/m<sup>3</sup> of D after 28 days. The use of <i>B. tequilensis</i> in B-FCB improved the compressive strength by 35.5% compared to the foamed concrete brick (FCB) after 28 days. A microstructure analysis by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) and X-ray diffraction analysis (XRD) reflected the changes in chemical element levels and calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) precipitation in the B-FCB pores.

Bioengineered human acellular vessels recellularize and evolve into living blood vessels after human implantation.,"Traditional vascular grafts constructed from synthetic polymers or cadaveric human or animal tissues support the clinical need for readily available blood vessels, but often come with associated risks. Histopathological evaluation of these materials has shown adverse host cellular reactions and/or mechanical degradation due to insufficient or inappropriate matrix remodeling. We developed an investigational bioengineered human acellular vessel (HAV), which is currently being studied as a hemodialysis conduit in patients with end-stage renal disease. In rare cases, small samples of HAV were recovered during routine surgical interventions and used to examine the temporal and spatial pattern of the host cell response to the HAV after implantation, from 16 to 200 weeks. We observed a substantial influx of alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA)-expressing cells into the HAV that progressively matured and circumferentially aligned in the HAV wall. These cells were supported by microvasculature initially formed by CD34<sup>+</sup>/CD31<sup>+</sup> cells in the neoadventitia and later maintained by CD34<sup>-</sup>/CD31<sup>+</sup> endothelial cells in the media and lumen of the HAV. Nestin<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells differentiated into either αSMA<sup>+</sup> or CD31<sup>+</sup> cells and may contribute to early recellularization and self-repair of the HAV. A mesenchymal stem cell-like CD90<sup>+</sup> progenitor cell population increased in number with duration of implantation. Our results suggest that host myogenic, endothelial, and progenitor cell repopulation of HAVs transforms these previously acellular vessels into functional multilayered living tissues that maintain blood transport and exhibit self-healing after cannulation injury, effectively rendering these vessels like the patient's own blood vessel.",Science translational medicine,eng,2019,Mar
Doubly Dynamic Hydrogel Formed by Combining Boronate Ester and Acylhydrazone Bonds.,"The incorporation of double dynamic bonds into hydrogels provides an effective strategy to engineer their performance on demand. Herein, novel hydrogels were PREPARED by combining two kinetically distinct dynamic covalent bonds, boronate ester and acylhydrazone bonds, and the synergistic properties of the hydrogels were studied comprehensively. The functional diblock copolymers P(<i>N</i>-isopropyl acrylamide-co-<i>N</i>-acryloyl-3-aminophenylboronic acid)-b-(<i>N</i>-isopropyl acrylamide-co-diacetone acrylamide) (PAD) were prepared via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. The hydrogel was constructed by exploiting dynamic reaction of phenyboronic acid moieties with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) and ketone moieties with adipic dihydrazide (ADH) without any catalyst. The active boronate ester linkage endows the hydrogel with fast gelation kinetics and self-healing ability, and the stable acylhydrazone linkage can enhance the mechanical property of the hydrogel. The difference in kinetics endows that the contribution of each linkage to mechanical strength of the hydrogel can be accurately estimated. Moreover, the mechanical property of the hydrogel can be readily engineered by changing the composition and solid content, as well as by controlling the formation or dissociation of the dynamic linkages. Thus, we provide a promising strategy to design and prepare multi-responsive hydrogels with tunable properties.",Polymers,eng,2020,Feb

An advanced Ca/Zn hybrid battery enabled by the dendrite-free zinc anode and a reversible calcification/decalcification NASICON cathode.,"The proposal of hybrid ion batteries, which can integrate the advantages of the single ion battery, opens up a new route for developing high-performance secondary batteries.

This exciting combination gives full play to not only the excellent diffusion dynamics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the NASICON (sodium super ion conductors) structure but also the electrostatic shielding effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with low reduction potential that inhibits the formation of zinc dendrites. As results, the NVP//Zn Zn/Ca hybrid battery delivers favorable specific capacity with outstanding rate performance (85.3 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> capacity at 1 C, 60.5 mAh g<sup>-1</sup> capacity at 20 C), and excellent cycle stability (74 % capacity retention after 1300 cycles).",Science bulletin,eng,2023,Jan

Cucurbituril-based supramolecular engineered nanostructured materials.,"Cucurbituril (CB) is a unique macrocycle with a rigid symmetrical structure, which is composed of two identical hydrophilic portals decorated with partially negatively charged carbonyl groups and a hydrophobic cavity. A number of different nanostructured materials, including nanoparticles, nanocomposites, vesicles and rods, have been prepared by taking advantage of the varying cavity size of the CB homologues, their ability to accommodate more than one guest in their cavities, their rigid symmetrical structures, as well as the water solubility of CB7.

Exploring nanofibrous self-assembling peptide hydrogels using mouse myoblast cells for three-dimensional bioprinting and tissue engineering applications.,"Injured skeletal muscles which lose more than 20% of their volume, known as volumetric muscle loss, can no longer regenerate cells through self-healing. The traditional solution for recovery is through regenerative therapy. As the technology of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting continues to advance, a new approach for tissue transplantation is using biocompatible materials arranged in 3D scaffolds for muscle repair. Ultrashort self-assembling peptide hydrogels compete as a potential biomaterial for muscle tissue formation due to their biocompatibility. In this study, two sequences of ultrashort peptides were analyzed with muscle myoblast cells (C2C12) for cell viability, cell proliferation, and differentiation in 3D cell culture. The peptides were then extruded through a custom-designed robotic 3D bioprinter to create cell-laden 3D structures. These constructs were also analyzed for cell viability through live/dead assay. Results showed that 3D bioprinted structures of peptide hydrogels could be used as tissue platforms for myotube formation - a process necessary for muscle repair.",International journal of bioprinting,eng,2019,No Data
Monitoring biocalcification potential of Lysinibacillus sp. isolated from alluvial soils for improved compressive strength of concrete.,"The present study reports the potential of newly isolated calcite precipitating bacteria isolated from alluvial soil to improve the strength and durability of concrete. A total of sixteen samples of alluvial soil and sewage were collected from the different locations of province Solan (India). For isolation, enrichment culture technique was used to enrich calcite precipitating strains in Urea broth. After enrichment, fourteen distinct bacterial strains were obtained on Urea agar. Based on qualitative and quantitative screening for urease activity, five isolates were obtained possessing higher calcite formation and urease activities (38-77 μmhos/cm) as compared with standard strain of Bacillus megaterium MTCC 1684 (77 μmhos/cm). An isolate I13 identified as Lysinibacillus sp. was selected for self healing property in the concrete mix of M20. An improved compressive strength of 1.5 fold was observed in concrete samples amended with Lysinibacillus sp. over the concrete amended with B. megaterium MTCC 1684 after 28 days of curing. The higher calcite precipitation activity was indicated in Lysinibacillus sp. by FE-SEM micrographs and EDX analysis.",Microbiological research,eng,2018,Mar
"Encoding, Reading, and Transforming Information Using Multifluorescent Supramolecular Polymeric Hydrogels.","Traditional (1D, 2D, and 3D) codes are widely used to provide convenient readouts of encoded information. However, manipulating and transforming the encoded information is typically difficult to achieve. Here, the preparation of three fluorescent (blue, green, and red) hydrogels containing both tetracationic receptor-anion recognition motifs and gel-specific fluorophores is reported, which may be used as building blocks to construct through physical adhesion fluorescent color 3D codes (Code A, Code B, and Code C) that may be read out by a smartphone. As a result, parts of the individual gel components that make up Code B can be replaced with other gel building blocks to form Code A via a cut and adhesion approach. A fluorophore responsive to ammonia is further incorporated into one of the hydrogels. This allows the gel block-derived pattern that makes up Code C to be converted to Code A by chemical means. Therefore, the encoded information produced by patterns of the present hydrogels may be transformed through either physical action or by exposure to a chemical stimulus. Due to the nature of the soft materials involved, the codes can be used as wearable materials.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2018,Mar
Programmable and Self-Healable Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators Based on Halogen Bonding.,"Shape-changing polymeric materials have gained significant attention in the field of bioinspired soft robotics. However, challenges remain in versatilizing the shape-morphing process to suit different tasks and environments, and in designing systems that combine reversible actuation and self-healing ability. Here, we report halogen-bonded liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) that can be arbitrarily shape-programmed and that self-heal under mild thermal or photothermal stimulation. We incorporate halogen-bond-donating diiodotetrafluorobenzene molecules as dynamic supramolecular crosslinks into the LCEs and show that these relatively weak crosslinks are pertinent for their mechanical programming and self-healing. Utilizing the halogen-bonded LCEs, we demonstrate proof-of-concept soft robotic motions such as crawling and rolling with programmed velocities. Our results showcase halogen bonding as a promising, yet unexplored tool for the preparation of smart supramolecular constructs for the development of advanced soft actuators.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),eng,2023,Sep
Direct 3D Bioprinting of Tough and Antifatigue Cell-Laden Constructs Enabled by a Self-Healing Hydrogel Bioink.,"Three-dimensional (3D) extrusion bioprinting has emerged as one of the most promising biofabrication technologies for preparing biomimetic tissue-like constructs. The successful construction of cell-laden constructs majorly relies on the development of proper bioinks with excellent printability and cytocompatibility. Bioinks based on gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) have been widely explored due to the excellent biocompatibility and biodegradability and the presence of the arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) sequences for cell adhesion. However, such bioinks usually require low-temperature or ionic cross-linking systems to solidify the extruded hydrogel structures, which results in complex processes and limitations to certain applications. Moreover, many current hydrogel-based bioinks, even after chemical cross-linking, hardly possess the required strength to resist the mechanical loads during the implantation procedure. Herein, we report a self-healing hydrogel bioink based on GelMA and oxidized dextran (OD) for the direct printing of tough and fatigue-resistant cell-laden constructs at room temperature without any template or cross-linking agents. Enabled by dynamic Schiff base chemistry, the mixed GelMA/OD solution showed the characteristics of a dynamic hydrogel with shear-thinning and self-supporting behavior, which allows bridging the 5 mm gap and efficient direct bioprinting of complex constructs with high shape fidelity. After photo-cross-linking, the resulting tissue constructs exhibited excellent low cell damage, high cell viability, and enhanced mechanical strength. Moreover, the GelMA/OD construct could resist up to 95% compressive deformation without any breakage and was able to maintain 80% of the original Young's modulus during long-term loading (50 cycles). It is believed that our GelMA/OD bioink would expand the potential of GelMA-based bioinks in applications such as tissue engineering and pharmaceutical screening.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2023,Jun
The Influence of Superabsorbent Polymers and Nanosilica on the Hydration Process and Microstructure of Cementitious Mixtures.,"Superabsorbent polymers (SAPs) are known to mitigate the development of autogenous shrinkage in cementitious mixtures with a low water-to-cement ratio. Moreover, the addition of SAPs promotes the self-healing ability of cracks. A drawback of using SAPs lies in the formation of macropores when the polymers release their absorbed water, leading to a reduction of the mechanical properties. Therefore, a supplementary material was introduced together with SAPs, being nanosilica, in order to obtain an identical compressive strength with respect to the reference material without additives. The exact cause of the similar compressive behaviour lies in the modification of the hydration process and subsequent microstructural development by both SAPs and nanosilica. Within the present study, the effect of SAPs and nanosilica on the hydration progress and the hardened properties is assessed. By means of isothermal calorimetry, the hydration kinetics were monitored. Subsequently, the quantity of hydration products formed was determined by thermogravimetric analysis and scanning electron microscopy, revealing an increased amount of hydrates for both SAP and nanosilica blends. An assessment of the pore size distribution was made using mercury intrusion porosimetry and demonstrated the increased porosity for SAP mixtures. A correlation between microstructure and the compressive strength displayed its influence on the mechanical behaviour.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Nov
Virtual reality and the psyche. Some psychoanalytic approaches to media addiction.,"This paper explores the ramifications of excessive use of media on personality development, the development of symbolic and thinking functions and on psychic reality. In doing so, the questions of whether there are specific media objects possessing an intrinsic symbolic quality, and which attachments in the inner world of a child/adolescent can be mobilized or destroyed are discussed. By selecting specific material, computer gamers use their game to activate the field of a personal psychic reality. Hereby, they attempt some kind of self-healing. However, after leaving the game, conflicts and traumata re-enacted but unresolved in the game disappear from their temporary representation without generating any resonance in the gamer's psychic experience. Consequently, although states of mind and affects are activated in the computer game, their processing and integration fail; the game results in a compulsive repetition. The construction and consolidation of retrievable maturation and structural development, the representation of the unrepresentable, succeed in the context of the triangulating analytic relationship, initially through a jointly performed symbolic and narrative re-experience or the recreation of the game. Theoretical considerations are illustrated by means of clinical vignettes.",The Journal of analytical psychology,eng,2015,Apr
"Dual Physically Cross-Linked Double Network Hydrogels with High Mechanical Strength, Fatigue Resistance, Notch-Insensitivity, and Self-Healing Properties.","Double-network (DN) hydrogels with high strength and toughness have been developed as promising materials. Herein, we explored a dual physically cross-linked polyacrylamide/xanthan gum (PAM/XG) DN hydrogel. The nonchemically cross-linked PAM/XG DN hydrogels exhibited fracture stresses as high as 3.64 MPa (13 times higher than the pure PAM single network hydrogel) and compressive stresses at 99% strain of more than 50 MPa. The hydrogels could restore their original shapes after continuously loading-unloading tensile and compressive cyclic tests. In addition, the PAM/XG DN hydrogels demonstrated excellent fatigue resistance, notch-insensitivity, high stability in different harsh environments, and remarkable self-healing properties, which might result from their distinctive physical-cross-linking structures. The attenuated total reflectance infrared spectroscopy (ATR-IR) and dynamic thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results indicated that there were no chemical bonds (only hydrogen bonds) between the XG and PAM networks. The PAM/XG DN hydrogel synthesis offers a new avenue for the design and construction of DN systems, broadening current research and applications of hydrogels with excellent mechanical properties.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2016,Dec
Self-crosslinking hyaluronic acid-carboxymethylcellulose hydrogel enhances multilayered 3D-printed construct shape integrity and mechanical stability for soft tissue engineering.,"One of the primary challenges in extrusion-based 3D bioprinting is the ability to print self-supported multilayered constructs with biocompatible hydrogels. The bioinks should have sufficient post-printing mechanical stability for soft tissue and organ regeneration. Here, we report on the synthesis, characterization and 3D printability of hyaluronic acid (HA)-carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) hydrogels cross-linked through N-acyl-hydrazone bonding. The hydrogel's hydrolytic stability was acquired by the effects of both the prevention of the oxidation of the six-membered rings of HA, and the stabilization of acyl-hydrazone bonds. The shear-thinning and self-healing properties of the hydrogel allowed us to print different 3D constructs (lattice, cubic and tube) of up to 50 layers with superior precision and high post-printing stability without support materials or post-processing depending on their compositions (H7:C3, H5:C5 and H3:C7). Morphological analyses of different zones of the 3D-printed constructs were undertaken for verification of the interconnection of pores. Texture profile analysis (TPA) (hardness (strength), elastic recovery, etc) and cyclic compression studies of the 3D-printed constructs demonstrated exceptional elastic properties and fast recovery after 50% strain, respectively, which have been attributed to the addition of CMC into HA. A model drug quercetin was released in a sustained manner from hydrogels and 3D constructs. In vitro cytotoxicity studies confirmed the excellent cyto-compatibility of these gels. In vivo mice studies prove that these biocompatible hydrogels enhance angiogenesis. The results indicate that controlling the key properties (e.g. self-crosslinking capacity, composition) can lead to the generation of multilayered constructs from 3D-bioprintable HA-CMC hydrogels capable of being leveraged for soft tissue engineering applications.",Biofabrication,eng,2020,Sep
Bioinspired porous membranes containing polymer nanoparticles for wound healing.,"Skin damages covering a surface larger than 4 cm(2) require a regenerative strategy based on the use of appropriate wound dressing supports to facilitate the rapid tissue replacement and efficient self-healing of the lost or damaged tissue. In the present work, A novel biomimetic approach is proposed for the design of a therapeutic porous construct made of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) fabricated by thermally induced phase separation (TIPS). Biomimicry of ECM was achieved by immobilization of type I collagen through a two-step plasma treatment for wound healing. Anti-inflammatory (indomethacin)-containing polymeric nanoparticles (nps) were loaded within the porous membranes in order to minimize undesired cell response caused by post-operative inflammation. The biological response to the scaffold was analyzed by using human keratinocytes cell cultures. In this work, a promising biomimetic construct for wound healing and soft tissue regeneration with drug-release properties was fabricated since it shows (i) proper porosity, pore size, and mechanical properties, (ii) biomimicry of ECM, and (iii) therapeutic potential.",Journal of biomedical materials research.

An antibacterial bilayer hydrogel modified by tannic acid with oxidation resistance and adhesiveness to accelerate wound repair.,"Bacterial infection and oxidative stress remain critical problems for wound closure because they frequently trigger severe complications and delay wound healing. In addition, maintaining a moist microenvironment can promote skin regeneration. In this study, a bilayer hydrogel modified with tannic acid (TA) was constructed to accelerate wound repair. The bilayer hydrogel, composed of a layer with large pores to absorb the fluids and allow gas exchange and small pores to maintain the wound moist and prevent bacterial invasion, was initially developed. Thereafter, TA was introduced into the hydrogel to form a dual crosslinked network and endowed the hydrogel with adhesiveness, antibacterial, and oxidation resistance. In addition, the TA@bilayer hydrogel exhibited shape memory behaviour and self-healing ability due to the hydrogen bonds formed between TA and the bilayer hydrogel. As a result, the TA@bilayer hydrogel significantly promoted wound closure by accelerating collagen deposition, reducing tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) levels, and facilitating the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).","Colloids and surfaces.

Sustainable Polyurethane Networks Based on Rosin with Reprocessing Performance.,"Rosin is an abundant natural product. In this paper, for the first time, a rosin derivative is employed as a monomer for the preparation of polyurethane vitrimers with improved properties. A novel rosin-based polyurethane vitrimers network was constructed by the reaction between isocyanates (HDI) as curing agent and monomers with alcohol groups modified from rosin. The dynamic rosin-based polyurethane vitrimers were characterized by FTIR and dynamic mechanical analysis. The obtained rosin-based polyurethane vitrimers possessed superior mechanical properties. Due to the dynamic urethane linkages, the network topologies of rosin-based polyurethane vitrimers could be altered, contributing self-healing and reprocessing abilities. Besides, we investigated the effects of healing time and temperature on the self-healing performance. Moreover, through a hot press, pulverized samples of 70%VPU<sub>OH</sub> could be reshaped several times, and the mechanical properties of the recycled samples were restored, with tensile strength being even higher than the of that of the original samples.",Polymers,eng,2021,Oct
Non-Fluorinated Flexible Superhydrophobic Surface with Excellent Mechanical Durability and Self-Cleaning Performance.,"Although plenty of superhydrophobic surfaces have been developed owing to their tremendous potential applications, it is still a great challenge for the superhydrophobic surfaces to possess environmental friendliness, biocompatibility, and mechanical durability simultaneously. Herein, a non-fluorinated flexible superhydrophobic surface was designed by constructing a film-substrate system with labyrinth-like wrinkles combining an intrinsically hydrophobic Zn film and a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. Excellent superhydrophobicity with a contact angle up to 168.5° and a slide angle as low as 0° has been achieved on the Zn/PDMS surface, which is attributed to the micro-/nano-textured structures of the labyrinth-like wrinkles, providing sufficient air pockets to form a stable Cassie-Baxter state. Furthermore, the Zn/PDMS surface retains excellent superhydrophobicity under stretching, bending, and twisting mechanical deformation up to 500 cycles due to the stability of the micro-/nano-textured structures of the labyrinth-like wrinkles protected by the fantastic self-healing ability of the micro-cracks. Additionally, the Zn/PDMS superhydrophobic surface possesses an outstanding self-cleaning performance for various contaminants. The present work provides a valuable routine to design non-fluorinated flexible superhydrophobic surfaces with superb mechanical durability and self-cleaning property as promising functional layers for flexible electronics, wearable devices, biomedical engineering, and so forth.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Jan
Maximizing Electron Channels Enabled by MXene Aerogel for High-Performance Self-Healable Flexible Electronic Skin.,"Among the increasingly popular miniature and flexible smart electronics, two-dimensional materials show great potential in the development of flexible electronics owing to their layered structures and outstanding electrical properties. MXenes have attracted much attention in flexible electronics owing to their excellent hydrophilicity and metallic conductivity. However, their limited interlayer spacing and tendency for self-stacking lead to limited changes in electron channels under external pressure, making it difficult to exploit their excellent surface metal conductivity. We propose a strategy for rapid gas foaming to construct interlayer tunable MXene aerogels. MXene aerogels with rich interlayer network structures generate maximized electron channels under pressure, facilitating the effective utilization of the surface metal properties of MXene; this forms a self-healable flexible pressure sensor with excellent sensing properties such as high sensitivity (1,799.5 kPa<sup>-1</sup>), fast response time (11 ms), and good cycling stability (>25,000 cycles). This pressure sensor has applications in human body detection, human-computer interaction, self-healing, remote monitoring, and pressure distribution identification.

Effect of Addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2</sup><sup>-</sup> Ions with Temperature Control on Self-Healing of Hardened Cement Paste.,"<b>:</b> Concrete has a remarkably low ratio of tensile strength to compressive strength, and is widely used in construction. However, the occurrence of cracks in a concrete structure is inevitable. Nevertheless, in the presence of adequate moisture, small cracks in the concrete structure exhibit a propensity to self-heal by getting filled due to the rehydration of cement particles and the subsequent precipitation of calcium carbonate (CaCO<sub>3</sub>). According to previous studies, the self-healing performance can be maximized by optimizing the temperature and pH to control the crystal formation of CaCO<sub>3</sub>. This study focused on the crystal form of CaCO<sub>3</sub> generated in the self-healing of a cement-based composite material. To evaluate the self-healing performance depending on the type of aqueous solution and the temperature, the weight change, the weight change rate, and the porosity reduction in each case were evaluated. Moreover, to increase the generation of CaCO<sub>3</sub> (which is a self-healing precipitate), nanosized ultrafine CO<sub>2</sub> bubbles using CO<sub>2</sub> gas were used, along with an adequate supply of Ca<sup>2+</sup> by adjusting the aqueous solution (Ca(OH)<sub>2</sub>, CaO + ethanol). For greater pore-filling effects by controlling the CaCO<sub>3</sub> crystal forms in the cement matrix, the change in the crystal form of the precipitated CaCO<sub>3</sub> in the hardened cement paste with changing temperature was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. As a result, the possibility of the effective generation and control of vaterite with a dense pore structure together with calcite was confirmed by adjusting the temperature to approximately 40 °C at a pH of 12.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2019,Aug
Microwave Absorption Ability of Steel Slag and Road Performance of Asphalt Mixtures Incorporating Steel Slag.,"Excessive usage of non-renewable natural resources and massive construction wastes put pressure on the environment. Steel slags, the main waste material from the metal industry, are normally added in asphalt concrete to replace traditional aggregate. In addition, as a typical microwave absorber, steel slag has the potential to transfer microwave energy into heat, thus increasing the limited self-healing ability of asphalt mixture. This paper aims to investigate the microwave absorption potentials of steel slag and the effect of its addition on road performance. The magnetic parameters obtained from a microwave vector network analyzer were used to estimate the potential use of steel slag as microwave absorber to heal cracks. Meanwhile, the initial self-healing temperature was further discussed according to the frequency sweeping results. The obvious porous structure of steel slag observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) had important impacts on the road performance of asphalt mixtures. Steel slag presented a worse effect on low-temperature crack resistance and water stability, while high-temperature stability can be remarkably enhanced when the substitution of steel slag was 60% by volume with the particle size of 4.75-9.5 mm. Overall, the sustainability of asphalt mixtures incorporating steel slag can be promoted due to its excellent mechanical and microwave absorption properties.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Feb

The gel RQ exhibits excellent self-healing capacity. Interestingly, the RQ could fluorescently detect and reversibly remove Hg2+ from water through cation-π interactions with high selectivity, efficient adsorption and quick response. The limit of lowest detection (LOD) of the RQ for Hg2+ is 4.52 × 10-8 M and the separation ratio is 91.14%. Moreover, the RQ could be efficiently recycled and regenerated with little loss via a simple treatment by I-.

Skin-adhesive lignin-grafted-polyacrylamide/hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogel sensor for real-time cervical spine bending monitoring in human-machine Interface.,"Developing a straightforward method to produce conductive hydrogels with excellent mechanical properties, self-adhesion, and biocompatibility remains a significant challenge. While current approaches aim to enhance mechanical performance, they often require additional steps or external forces for fixation, leading to increased production time and limited practicality. A novel lignin-grafted polyacrylamide/hydroxypropyl cellulose hydrogel (L-g-PAM/HPC hydrogel) with a semi-interpenetrating polymer network structure had been developed in this research that boasted exceptional adhesion to the skin (∼68 kPa) and stretchability properties (∼1637 %) compared to PAM-based hydrogels.

"Injectable, Self-Healing, and Multi-Responsive Hydrogels via Dynamic Covalent Bond Formation between Benzoxaborole and Hydroxyl Groups.","Hydrogels that are injectable, self-healing, and multiresponsive are becoming increasingly relevant for a wide range of applications. In this work, we have successfully developed a novel approach in the fabrication of smart hydrogels with all the above properties. A symmetrical ABA triblock copolymer was first synthesized via atom transfer radical polymerization with a temperature responsive middle block and two permanently hydrophilic glycopolymer chains on both ends. Hydrogels were subsequently constructed by mixing the triblock copolymer with another linear hydrophilic copolymer bearing benzoxaborole groups. The interactions of the benzoxaborole groups with the sugar hydroxyl groups allowed the formation of dynamic covalent bonds. The resulting hydrogels exhibited temperature, pH, and sugar responsiveness. Rheological studies confirmed that the mechanical property can be tuned by changing the pH as well as the galactose/benzoxaborole molar ratio. Furthermore, the hydrogels showed excellent self-healing ability and shear-thinning performance due to the inherent well-known dynamic covalent bonds of boronic esters.

Maximizing the ion accessibility and high mechanical strength in nanoscale ion channel MXene electrodes for high-capacity zinc-ion energy storage.,"Two-dimensional transition-metal carbides (MXenes) have superhydrophilic surfaces and superior metal conductivity, making them competitive in the field of electrochemical energy storage. However, MXenes with layered structures are easily stackable, which reduces the ion accessibility and transport paths, thus limiting their electrochemical performance. To fully exploit the advantages of MXenes in electrochemical energy storage, this study reports the etching of large-sized MXene into nanosheets with nanoscale ion channels via a chemical oxidation method. While the resulting ion-channel MXene electrodes retain the excellent mechanical strength and electrical conductivity of large-sized MXene nanosheets, they can effectively shorten the ion transport distance and improve the overall electrochemical activity.

A Novel Design of Autonomously Healed Concrete: Towards a Vascular Healing Network.,"Concrete is prone to crack formation in the tensile zone, which is why steel reinforcement is introduced in these zones. However, small cracks could still arise, which give liquids and gasses access to the reinforcement causing it to corrode. Self-healing concrete repairs and seals these small (300 µm) cracks, preventing the development of corrosion. In this study, a vascular system, carrying the healing agent, is developed. It consists of tubes connected to a 3D printed distribution piece. This distribution piece has four outlets that are connected to the tubes and has one inlet, which is accessible from outside. Several materials were considered for the tubes, i.e., polymethylmethacrylate, starch, inorganic phosphate cement and alumina.

Mechanical and Self-Healing Behavior of Matrix-Free Polymer Nanocomposites Constructed via Grafted Graphene Nanosheets.,"Through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, the structure and mechanical properties of matrix-free polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) constructed via polymer-grafted graphene nanosheets are studied. The dispersion of graphene sheets is characterized by the radial distribution function (RDF) between graphene sheets. We observe that a longer polymer chain length <i>L</i><sub>g</sub> leads to a relatively better dispersion state attributed to the formation of a better brick-mud structure, effectively screening the van der Waals interactions between sheets. By tuning the interaction strength ε<sub>end-end</sub> between end functional groups of grafted chains, we construct physical networks with various robustness characterized by the formation of the fractal clusters at high ε<sub>end-end</sub> values. The effects of ε<sub>end-end</sub> and <i>L</i><sub>g</sub> on the mechanical properties are examined, and the enhancement of the stress-strain behavior is observed with the increase of ε<sub>end-end</sub> and <i>L</i><sub>g</sub>. Structural evolution during deformation is quantified by calculating the orientation of the graphene sheets and their distribution, the stress decomposition, and the size of the clusters formed between end groups and their distribution. Then, we briefly study the effects of time and temperature on the self-healing behavior of these unique PNCs in the rubbery state. Lastly, the self-healing kinetics is quantitatively analyzed. In general, this work can provide some rational guidelines to design and fabricate matrix-free PNCs with both excellent mechanical and self-healing properties.",Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,eng,2020,Jul

Here, a gel matrix containing aminopropyl methacrylamide (APMA), glucose oxidase (GOx), and nanoceria-stabilized extracted chloroplasts that is able to grow, strengthen, and self-repair using carbon fixation is demonstrated. Glucose produced from the embedded chloroplasts is converted to gluconolactone (GL) via GOx, polymerizing with APMA to form a continuously expanding and strengthening polymethacrylamide.

A new helicide-based elastomer network is developed here with self-healing, recycling, and degradation features using a similar concept. The best self-healing performance (100%) was noted over 10-20 min, with various H<sub>2</sub>O, HCl, and NaOH solutions that delivered mechanical properties in the 1-1.4 MPa range. For hydrolytic degradation, the parameters are defined based on the type of binding, the pH of the solutions, and the copolymer network, which endowed a degradation time of approximately 4-11 h for each prepared sample. However, due to the reversible nature of the dynamic bonds, the material showed good recyclable mechanical properties compared to the pristine samples after five consecutive cycles, which meet the requirements of recyclable materials and recyclable packaging.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,Oct
Self-Consistent Field Lattice Model for Polymer Networks.,"A lattice model based on polymer self-consistent field theory is developed to predict the equilibrium statistics of arbitrary polymer networks. For a given network topology, our approach uses moment propagators on a lattice to self-consistently construct the ensemble of polymer conformations and cross-link spatial probability distributions. Remarkably, the calculation can be performed ""in the dark"", without any prior knowledge on preferred chain conformations or cross-link positions. Numerical results from the model for a test network exhibit close agreement with molecular dynamics simulations, including when the network is strongly sheared. Our model captures nonaffine deformation, mean-field monomer interactions, cross-link fluctuations, and finite extensibility of chains, yielding predictions that differ markedly from classical rubber elasticity theory for polymer networks. By examining polymer networks with different degrees of interconnectivity, we gain insight into cross-link entropy, an important quantity in the macroscopic behavior of gels and self-healing materials as they are deformed.",Macromolecules,eng,2017,Dec
Dual-Dynamic Chemistries-Based Fast-Reprocessing and High-Performance Covalent Adaptable Networks.,"Covalent adaptable networks (CANs) possess multiple functions including reprocessing (or recyclability), self-healing, welding, shape shifting, 3D printing, etc., due to the network rearrangement from dynamic bonds, and favorable performance from their cross-linked feature, and they are supposed to be as sustainable alternatives to thermosets. However, the thermal and mechanical properties, and stability of CANs are often sacrificed for rapid network rearrangement. In this paper, fast-reprocessing CANs with high performance are facilely constructed by in situ polymerization and dynamic cross-linking of styrene (St), maleic anhydride (MA), and acetal diol (BHAD). The rigid and hydrophobic polymer backbone endow the materials with high glass transition temperatures, mechanical performance, and water resistance. Besides, carboxylic group-catalyzed dual dynamic ester and acetal-based networks exhibit faster stress relaxation and realize extrusion reprocessing. This work provides an ingenious and simple strategy of construction of CANs combining rapid network rearrangement and excellent comprehensive performance, which is beneficial for the application of CANs.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2023,Feb

Toward a versatile toolbox for cucurbit[<i>n</i>]uril-based supramolecular hydrogel networks through <i>in situ</i> polymerization.,"The success of exploiting cucurbit[<i>n</i>]uril (CB[<i>n</i>])-based molecular recognition in self-assembled systems has sparked a tremendous interest in polymer and materials chemistry. In this study, polymerization in the presence of host-guest complexes is applied as a modular synthetic approach toward a diverse set of CB[8]-based supramolecular hydrogels with desirable properties, such as mechanical strength, toughness, energy dissipation, self-healing, and shear-thinning. A range of vinyl monomers, including acrylamide-, acrylate-, and imidazolium-based hydrophilic monomers, could be easily incorporated as the polymer backbones, leading to a library of CB[8] hydrogel networks.

Optimization of Sporulation and Germination Conditions of Functional Bacteria for Concrete Crack-Healing and Evaluation of their Repair Capacity.,"While microbial spore production and germination of bacteria have been widely studied for their applications in animal husbandry, aquatic products, medicine, and food, few studies have investigated their use for the crack-healing of concrete. To effectively heal the cracks in concrete, studies suggest that the rate of sporulation and the germination of bacteria should be sufficiently high. This study investigates the effects of different carbon sources, nitrogen sources, Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations, and external culture conditions on the sporulation rate and analyzes the effects of the pH value, heat activation, germinants, various cations, and nutrients on the germination of spores. <i>Bacillus cohnii (B. cohnii</i>) is chosen as the bacterium to be mixed in concrete because of its alkalophilic nature. The mineralization activity of spores after germination and the crack-healing capacity of concrete are studied. The optimal culture medium and the optimum external conditions for spore production are obtained. The total cell count and sporulation rate of bacteria obtained on this medium are 3.14 × 10<sup>9</sup> CFU/mL and 92.6%, respectively, under the optimum external conditions. The optimal pH value for the spore germination of <i>B. cohnii</i> is 9.7. While the cation Na<sup>+</sup> strongly stimulates the germination of <i>B. cohnii</i> spores, other cations (such as K<sup>+</sup>, NH<sub>4</sub><sup>+</sup>, and Ca<sup>2+</sup>) do not stimulate spore germination. The optimal concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> is 200 mM. The germination rate of spores in the control group concrete specimen (room temperature 24°C) was more than 50%, thus suggesting that <i>B. cohnii</i> bacteria can be used in the self-healing of concrete cracks. The mineralization activity test proves that the spores of <i>B. cohnii</i> have a mineralizing function after germination, and the crystals produced by microbial-induced carbonate precipitation (MICP) are of pure calcite. When the crack width of the concrete specimen with spores of <i>B. cohnii</i> is less than 1.2 mm, it can be completely repaired after 28 days of healing.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Mar
Construction and Hierarchical Self-Assembly of a Supramolecular Metal-Carbene Complex with Multifunctional Units.,"Hierarchical combinations involving metal-ligand interactions and host-guest interactions can consolidate building blocks with unique functions into material properties.

In addition, we investigated the host-guest interactions between multifunctional trinuclear AuI tricarbene complex and organic ammonium salts, revealing crown ether-based host-guest interactions can effectively regulate the electrochemical properties of the complex.

Dynamic ionic behavior of gel-free diolefin rubber-based carboxylate ionomers prepared <i>via</i> olefin metathesis.,"Constructing dynamic ionic bonding interactions is acknowledged as an efficient strategy to improve the physical-mechanical characteristics of rubber materials, and to provide them with some novel features such as self-healing. However, currently reported grafting-modification approaches such as free-radical and anionic reactions inevitably induced the generation of rubber gels, which is unfavorable for their practical applications. In this work, we fabricated a gel-free carbonylated diolefin rubber based on the olefin metathesis reaction. Furthermore, a diolefin rubber-based ionomer was prepared through the complexation of carbonylated diolefin rubber and sodium hydroxide. Compared with pure diolefin rubber, the resultant ionomers exhibited a higher glass transition temperature (<i>T</i><sub>g</sub>), higher mechanical strength and higher damping properties. Moreover, these ionomers were provided with apparent self-healing behavior. This was primarily because of the increased dynamic ionic bonding interactions induced by the formation of multi-ion-pair cluster structures, a unique intermolecular interaction that exists in the ionomers. Consequently, the gel-free diolefin rubber-based ionomers offer some brand-new applications, such as artificial skin and high-performance ""green"" tires.",Soft matter,eng,2022,Mar
Transient response of nonlinear polymer networks: A kinetic theory.,"Dynamic networks are found in a majority of natural materials, but also in engineering materials, such as entangled polymers and physically cross-linked gels. Owing to their transient bond dynamics, these networks display a rich class of behaviors, from elasticity, rheology, self-healing, or growth. Although classical theories in rheology and mechanics have enabled us to characterize these materials, there is still a gap in our understanding on how individuals (i.e., the mechanics of each building blocks and its connection with others) affect the emerging response of the network. In this work, we introduce an alternative way to think about these networks from a statistical point of view. More specifically, a network is seen as a collection of individual polymer chains connected by weak bonds that can associate and dissociate over time. From the knowledge of these individual chains (elasticity, transient attachment, and detachment events), we construct a statistical description of the population and derive an evolution equation of their distribution based on applied deformation and their local interactions. We specifically concentrate on nonlinear elastic response that follows from the strain stiffening response of individual chains of finite size. Upon appropriate averaging operations and using a mean field approximation, we show that the distribution can be replaced by a so-called chain distribution tensor that is used to determine important macroscopic measures such as stress, energy storage and dissipation in the network. Prediction of the kinetic theory are then explored against known experimental measurement of polymer responses under uniaxial loading. It is found that even under the simplest assumptions of force-independent chain kinetics, the model is able to reproduce complex time-dependent behaviors of rubber and self-healing supramolecular polymers.",Journal of the mechanics and physics of solids,eng,2018,Jun

"Assembling Microgels via Dynamic Cross-Linking Reaction Improves Printability, Microporosity, Tissue-Adhesion, and Self-Healing of Microgel Bioink for Extrusion Bioprinting.","Extrusion bioprinting has been widely used to fabricate complicated and heterogeneous constructs for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Despite the remarkable progress acquired so far, the exploration of qualified bioinks is still challenging, mainly due to the conflicting requirements on the printability/shape-fidelity and cell viability. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to formulate a dynamic cross-linked microgel assembly (DC-MA) bioink, which can achieve both high printability/shape-fidelity and high cell viability by strengthening intermicrogel interactions through dynamic covalent bonds while still maintaining the relatively low mechanical modulus of microgels. As a proof-of-concept, microgels are prepared by cross-linking hyaluronic acid modified with methacrylate and phenylboric acid groups (HAMA-PBA) and methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) via droplet-based microfluidics, followed by assembling into DC-MA bioink with a dynamic cross-linker (dopamine-modified hyaluronic acid, HA-DA). As a result, 2D and 3D constructs with high shape-fidelity can be printed without post-treatment, and the encapsulated L929 cells exhibit high cell viability after extrusion. Moreover, the addition of the dynamic cross-linker (HA-DA) also improves the microporosity, tissue-adhesion, and self-healing of the DC-MA bioink, which is very beneficial for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine applications including wound healing. We believe the present work sheds a new light on designing new bioinks for extrusion bioprinting.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Apr
Double crosslinked biomimetic composite hydrogels containing topographical cues and WAY-316606 induce neural tissue regeneration and functional recovery after spinal cord injury.,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) is an overwhelming and incurable disabling condition, for which increasing forms of multifunctional biomaterials are being tested, but with limited progression. The promising material should be able to fill SCI-induced cavities and direct the growth of new neurons, with effective drug loading to improve the local micro-organism environment and promote neural tissue regeneration. In this study, a double crosslinked biomimetic composite hydrogel comprised of acellularized spinal cord matrix (ASCM) and gelatin-acrylated-β-cyclodextrin-polyethene glycol diacrylate (designated G-CD-PEGDA) hydrogel, loaded with WAY-316606 to activate canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and reinforced by a bundle of three-dimensionally printed aligned polycaprolactone (PCL) microfibers, was constructed. The G-CD-PEGDA component endowed the composite hydrogel with a dynamic structure with a self-healing capability which enabled cell migration, while the ASCM component promoted neural cell affinity and proliferation. The diffusion of WAY-316606 could recruit endogenous neural stem cells and improve neuronal differentiation. The aligned PCL microfibers guided neurite elongation in the longitudinal direction. Animal behavior studies further showed that the composite hydrogel could significantly recover the motor function of rats after SCI. This study provides a proficient approach to produce a multifunctional system with desirable physiological, chemical, and topographical cues for treating patients with SCI.",Bioactive materials,eng,2023,Jun
Toward Excellent Energy Storage Performance via Well-Aligned and Isolated Interfaces in Multicomponent Polypropylene-Based All-Organic Polymer Dielectric Films.,"Polypropylene (PP) serves as an excellent commercialized polymer dielectric film owing to its high breakdown strength, excellent self-healing ability, and flexibility. However, its low dielectric constant causes the large volume of the capacitor. Constructing multicomponent polypropylene-based all-organic polymer dielectric films is a facile strategy for achieving high energy density and efficiency simultaneously. Thereinto, the interfaces between the components become the key factors that determine the energy storage performance of the dielectric films. In this work, we propose to fabricate high-performance polyamide 513 (PA513)/PP all-organic polymer dielectric films <i>via</i> the construction of abundant well-aligned and isolated nanofibrillar interfaces. Laudably, a significant enhancement in the breakdown strength is achieved from 573.1 MV/m of pure PP to 692.3 MV/m with 5 wt % of PA513 nanofibrils. Besides, a maximum discharge energy density of about 4.4 J/cm<sup>2</sup> is realized with 20 wt % of PA513 nanofibrils, which is about 1.6-folds higher than pure PP. Simultaneously, the energy efficiency of samples with modulated interfaces maintains higher than 80% up to 600 MV/m, which is much higher than pure PP of about 40.7% at 550 MV/m. This work provides a new strategy to fabricate high-performance multicomponent all-organic polymer dielectric films on an industrial scale.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,May
Illustration and application of enhancing effect of arginine on interactions between nano-clays: self-healing hydrogels.,"Nano-clays (NCs) as a representative type of nano-materials are a source of inspiration for design of new biomedical materials with excellent performances. Research has shown that guanidinium ions (Gu+) can form non-covalent salt-bridge interactions with NCs, serving as ""molecular glue"" in the fabrication of NC-based composites. However, synthesis of the Gu+-containing molecules is always not easy. Since the natural amino acid arginine (Arg) possesses Gu+, Arg could potentially be a replacement for the synthetic molecules. To prove this possibility, nano-composites were constructed by combining model anisotropic NCs with Arg-modified nano-hydroxyapatite (nHAP-Arg) and polyarginine (poly-Arg), respectively. Formation of molecular interactions between NCs and nHAP-Arg/poly-Arg was demonstrated by enhanced gelation behaviour of NCs. Through taking the unique advantage of Arg, this study can be readily implemented in constructing a variety of NC-based composites with diverse functionalities that are necessary for potential applications in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.",Soft matter,eng,2019,Jan
Enhancement of oxidation resistance via a self-healing boron carbide coating on diamond particles.,"A boron carbide coating was applied to diamond particles by heating the particles in a powder mixture consisting of H3BO3, B and Mg. The composition, bond state and coverage fraction of the boron carbide coating on the diamond particles were investigated. The boron carbide coating prefers to grow on the diamond (100) surface than on the diamond (111) surface. A stoichiometric B4C coating completely covered the diamond particle after maintaining the raw mixture at 1200 °C for 2 h. The contribution of the boron carbide coating to the oxidation resistance enhancement of the diamond particles was investigated. During annealing of the coated diamond in air, the priory formed B2O3, which exhibits a self-healing property, as an oxygen barrier layer, which protected the diamond from oxidation. The formation temperature of B2O3 is dependent on the amorphous boron carbide content. The coating on the diamond provided effective protection of the diamond against oxidation by heating in air at 1000 °C for 1 h. Furthermore, the presence of the boron carbide coating also contributed to the maintenance of the static compressive strength during the annealing of diamond in air.",Scientific reports,eng,2016,Feb
Strategy for Constructing Phosphorus-Based Flame-Retarded Polyurethane Elastomers for Advanced Performance in Long-Term.,"Polyurethane elastomer (PUE), which is widely used in coatings for construction, transportation, electronics, aerospace, and other fields, has excellent physical properties. However, polyurethane elastomers are flammable, which limits their daily use, so the flame retardancy of polyurethane elastomers is very important. Reactive flame retardants have the advantages of little influence on the physical properties of polymers and low tendency to migrate out. Due to the remarkable needs of non-halogenated flame retardants, phosphorus flame retardant has gradually stood out as the main alternative. In this review, we focus on the fire safety of PUE and provide a detailed overview of the current molecular design and mechanisms of reactive phosphorus-containing, as well as P-N synergistic, flame retardants in PUE. From the structural characteristics, several basic aspects of PUE are overviewed, including thermal performance, combustion performance, and mechanical properties. In addition, the perspectives on the future advancement of phosphorus-containing flame-retarded polyurethane elastomers (PUE) are also discussed. Based on the past research, this study provides prospects for the application of flame-retarded PUE in the fields of self-healing materials, bio-based materials, wearable electronic devices, and solid-state electrolytes.",Polymers,eng,2023,Sep
Stimulus Responsive Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework to Achieve Corrosion Sensing and Active Protecting in Polymeric Coatings.,"Metal substrates beneath polymeric coatings are susceptible to localized corrosion, which could result in lifetime reduction and catastrophic failure without timely repair treatment. In situ detection of corrosion and repair coating defects are in high demand yet challenging to fulfill so far. Herein, we report a smart polymeric coating by integrating nanosensors into the coating matrix, which is capable of efficient corrosion sensing and active anticorrosion protecting. The nanosensors were constructed by zeolitic imidazolate framework encapsulated with the polyethylene glycol-tannic acid complex. The morphology, chemical constitution, and stimulus responsiveness of nanosensors were systematically analyzed. The generation of local corrosion beneath coating can be promptly sensed and reported by a conspicuous purple color derived from tannic-iron ion coordinates. Meanwhile, local electrochemical impedance spectroscopy results proved that the metal degradation process at the defected interface can be largely inhibited, exhibiting active anticorrosion property. Furthermore, the constructed smart coating possessed superior impermeability and long-term protective performance under simulated seawater and harsh salts spray conditions. This feasible and effective strategy based on simple nanosensors to engineer smart coatings paves a new way to develop high environmental adaptability protective materials with protecting, corrosion sensing, and self-healing functions.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Jan
Laboratory development and field demonstration of self-sealing/self-healing landfill liner.,"The self-sealing/self-healing (SS/SH) barrier concept is based on the principle that two or more parent materials placed in vertical or horizontal layers will react at their interfaces to form insoluble reaction products. These products constitute a seamless impermeable seal, which is resistant to the transmission of leachate and contaminants. A SS/SH liner formulation was developed in the laboratory and demonstrated at the Sudokwon landfill site in South Korea. Laboratory testing results indicated that a seal with a hydraulic conductivity less than 10(-9) m/s formed after two to four weeks of curing at room temperature, and the seal healed itself after it was fractured. The use of the soil from the Sudokwon landfill site instead of sand as the matrix of the parent materials in the SS/SH liner retarded the sealing and healing of the seal, but did not show an obvious effect on the overall sealing and healing capacity of the seal at early stages. The construction and installation of the field demonstration SS/SH liner were carried out in the same way as for a soil cement liner. The quality of the liner was ensured by the enforcement of quality analysis/quality control procedures during installation. A single sealed ring infiltration test was performed on the field demonstration liner 36 days after the installation was completed. The measurement of water infiltration rate indicated that the liner healed after it was fractured. However, the long-term sealing and healing capacity needs to be further investigated.","Waste management (New York, N.Y.)",eng,2005,No Data
Effect of Clinker Binder and Aggregates on Autogenous Healing in Post-Crack Flexural Behavior of Concrete Members.,"Crack healing has been studied extensively to protect reinforced concrete structures from the ingress of harmful ions. Research examining the regain in the mechanical properties of self-healing composites has focused mostly on the computation of the healing ratio based on the measurement of the tensile and compressive strengths but with poor regard for the flexural performance. However, the regain in the flexural performance should also be investigated for design purposes. The present study performs flexural testing on reinforced concrete members using crushed clinker binder and aggregates as well as crystalline admixtures as healing agents. Healing ratios of 100% for crack widths smaller than 200 μm and 85% to 90% for crack widths of 250 μm were observed according to the admixing of clinker binder and aggregates. Water flow test showed that the members replacing binder by 100% of clinker achieved the best crack healing performance. The crack healing property of concrete improved to some extent the rebar yield load, the members' ultimate load and energy absorption capacity and ductility index. The crack distribution density from the observed crack patterns confirmed the crack healing effect provided by clinker powder. The fine grain size of clinker made it possible to replace fine aggregates and longer healing time increased the crack healing effect.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Oct
A first step towards computational design of W-containing self-healing ferritic creep resistant steels.,"In this work, we combine a generic alloy-by-design model with a novel concept, the nucleation barrier for the formation of Laves phase to fill the creep cavities, in order to develop multi-component creep resistant steels with kinetically tuned self-healing behaviour. In the model the high-temperature long-term strength is estimated by integrating precipitation strengthening due to M23C6 carbides and solid solution strengthening, while the optimized compositional solutions are determined by employing the coupled thermodynamic and kinetic principles. W-containing Laves phase herein is selected as the self-healing agent to autonomously fill the grain boundary cavities, so as to prolong the creep lifetime. To achieve the effective healing reaction, the nucleation time for Laves precipitates are expected to coincide simultaneously with which creep cavities start to form or reach a healable size. Using experimental data from literature, an empirical relationship to estimate the incubation time for Laves phase formation has been constructed, from which the thermodynamic driving force for onset of precipitation as a function of temperature and intended precipitate nucleation time was derived. Three sample alloys have been selected among the desirable solutions, which are predicted to have the same strength but widely different Laves phase nucleation times. The calculations are also performed for different use temperatures to explore the compatibility between high temperature strength and timely cavity filling behaviour. In its current form the model is not expected to yield the truly optimal composition but to demonstrate how the kinetics of the healing reaction can affect the predicted optimal alloy compositions.",Science and technology of advanced materials,eng,2020,Sep
Hydrogen-Bonded Organic Frameworks as a Tunable Platform for Functional Materials.,"As a novel class of porous crystalline materials, hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs), self-assembled from organic or metal-organic building blocks through intermolecular hydrogen-bonding interactions, have attracted more and more attention. Over the past decade, a number of porous HOFs have been constructed through judicious selection of H-bonding motifs, which are further enforced by other weak intermolecular interactions such as π-π stacking and van der Waals forces and framework interpenetration. Since the H-bonds are weaker than coordinate and covalent bonds used for the construction of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), HOFs have some unique features such as mild synthesis condition, solution processability, easy healing, and regeneration. These features enable HOFs to be a tunable platform for the construction of functional materials. Here, we review the H-bonding motifs used for constructing porous HOFs and highlight some of their applications, including gas separation and storage, chiral separation and structure determination, fluorescent sensing, heterogeneous catalysis, biological applications, proton conduction, photoluminescent materials, and membrane-based applications.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,eng,2020,Aug
Protein-Metal-Ion Networks: A Unique Approach toward Metal Sulfide Nanoparticles Embedded In Situ in Nanocomposites.,"Nanoscale metal sulfides are of tremendous potential in biomedicine.

"Highly Stretchable, Self-Healable Elastomers from Hydrogen-Bonded Interpolymer Complex (HIPC) and Their Use as Sensitive, Stable Electric Skin.","There is a growing interest in developing stretchable strain sensors to quantify the large mechanical deformation and strain associated with the activities for a wide range of species. Herein, we constructed elastomeric, healable hydrogen-bonded interpolymer complex (HIPC) rubberlike film by complexation of hydrogen-bond (H-bond)-donating poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) and H-bond-accepting poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) (or poly(ethylene oxide)-poly(propylene oxide)-poly(ethylene oxide) (F108)). All HIPC elastomers prepared from varied PAA/PEO (or PAA/F108) ratios are healable elastomers with high extensibility (with the highest strain of 1400%). Recovery of all films can automatically occur or be accelerated by externally added water droplet. The stress- and strain healing efficiencies (η<sub>σ</sub> and η<sub>ε</sub>) of the water-assisting healed PAA/F108 blends are as high as 99%. Furthermore, stretchable and healable conductor films were fabricated from silver nanowire-printed (Ag-p) and the single-walled carbon nanotube-blended (SW-b) conductor films, respectively. The healable Ag-p conductor film is an ultrasensitive strain sensor, exhibiting large electric resistance variation when stretched. In contrast, the healable SW-b film is an ultrastable strain sensor with reversible resistance strain response over 200 stretching release cycles within a high strain range of 500%. Therefore, this study provides a new and flexible HIPC strategy for the fabrication of stretchable, ultrasensitive, and stable self-healing electrode materials.",ACS omega,eng,2018,Sep
Room temperature liquid metals for flexible alkali metal-chalcogen batteries.,"Flexibility has become a certain trend in the development of secondary batteries to meet the requirements of wide portability and applicability. On account of their intrinsic high energy density, flexible alkali metal-chalcogen batteries are attracting increasing interest. Although great advances have been made in promoting the electrochemical performance of metal-S or metal-Se batteries, explorations on flexible chalcogen-based batteries are still limited. Extensive and rational use of soft materials for electrodes is the main bottleneck. The re-emergence of safe liquid metals (LMs), which provide an ideal combination of metallic and fluidic properties at room temperature, offers a fascinating paradigm for constructing flexible chalcogen batteries. They may provide dendrite-free anodes and restrain the dissolution of polysulfides and polyselenides for cathodes. From this perspective, we elaborate on the appealing features of LMs for the construction of flexible metal-chalcogen batteries. Recent advances on LM-based battery are discussed, covering novel liquid alkali metals as anodes and LM-sulfur hybrids as cathodes, with the focus placed on durable high-energy-density output and self-healing flexible capability. At last, perspectives are proposed on the future development of LM-based chalcogen batteries, and the viable strategies to meet the current challenges that are obstructing more practical flexible chalcogen batteries.","Exploration (Beijing, China)",eng,2022,Oct
Harnessing entropy to enhance toughness in reversibly crosslinked polymer networks.,"Reversible crosslinking is a design paradigm for polymeric materials, wherein they are microscopically reinforced with chemical species that form transient crosslinks between the polymer chains. Besides the potential for self-healing, recent experimental work suggests that freely diffusing reversible crosslinks in polymer networks, such as gels, can enhance the toughness of the material without substantial change in elasticity. This presents the opportunity for making highly elastic materials that can be strained to a large extent before rupturing. Here, we employ Gaussian chain theory, molecular simulation, and polymer self-consistent field theory for networks to construct an equilibrium picture for how reversible crosslinks can toughen a polymer network without affecting its elasticity. Maximisation of polymer entropy drives the reversible crosslinks to bind preferentially near the permanent crosslinks in the network, leading to local molecular reinforcement without significant alteration of the network topology. In equilibrium conditions, permanent crosslinks share effectively the load with neighbouring reversible crosslinks, forming multi-functional crosslink points. The network is thereby globally toughened, while the linear elasticity is left largely unaltered. Practical guidelines are proposed to optimise this design in experiment, along with a discussion of key kinetic and timescale considerations.",Soft matter,eng,2019,Mar
Multi-Physically Cross-Linked Hydrogels for Flexible Sensors with High Strength and Self-Healing Properties.,"Excellent mechanical properties and self-healing properties are very important for the practical application of hydrogel flexible sensors. In this study, acrylic acid and stearyl methyl acrylate were selected as monomers to synthesize hydrophobic association hydrogels, and multi-physically cross-linked hydrogels were synthesized by adding ferric chloride and polyvinyl alcohol to introduce ion interaction and a hydrogen bond cross-linking network. The hydrogels were characterized by FTIR, XRD and SEM, and the mechanical properties and self-healing properties were tested using a universal testing machine. It was confirmed that the strength of the hydrogel was significantly improved with the addition of ferric chloride and polyvinyl alcohol, and the hydrogel still showed good self-healing properties. Further testing of its application as a conductive sensor has demonstrated sensitive and stable motion sensing capabilities. This provides an important reference for high-performance hydrogel sensors with both high strength and self-healing properties.",Polymers,eng,2023,Sep
Magnetic microspheres mimicking certain functions of macrophages: Towards precise antibacterial potency for bone defect healing.,"A variety of novel biomaterials have recently been developed to promote bone regeneration. However, the current biomaterials cannot accurately and effectively resist bacterial invasion. In this study, we constructed microspheres that mimic certain functions of macrophages as additives to bone repair materials, which can be manipulated as demanded to resist bacteria effectively and protect bone defect healing. Firstly, we prepared gelatin microspheres (GMSs) by an emulsion-crosslinking method, which were subsequently coated with polydopamine (PDA). Then, amino antibacterial nanoparticles obtained by a nanoprecipitation-self-assembly method and commercial amino magnetic nanoparticles were modified onto these PDA-coated GMSs to construct the functionalized microspheres (FMSs). The results showed that the FMSs possessed a rough topography and could be manipulated by a 100-400 ​mT static magnetic field to migrate directionally in unsolidified hydrogels. Moreover, <i>in vitro</i> experiments with near-infrared (NIR) showed that the FMSs had a sensitive and recyclable photothermal performance and could capture and kill <i>Porphyromonas gingivalis</i> by releasing reactive oxygen species. Finally, the FMSs were mixed with osteogenic hydrogel precursor, injected into the Sprague-Dawley <i>rat</i> periodontal bone defect of maxillary first molar (M1), and subsequently driven by magnetism to the cervical surface of M1 and the outer surface of the gel system for targeted sterilization under NIR, thus protecting the bone defect healing. In conclusion, the FMSs had excellent manipulation and antimicrobial performances. This provided us with a promising strategy to construct light-magnetism-responsive antibacterial materials to build a beneficial environment for bone defect healing.",Materials today.

The system exhibited morphological evolution with the increase of FA concentration; various phases such as vesicles, fiber/vesicles, fiber/nanoparticles, nanoparticles were probed. In the self-assembly process, l-glutamic acid moiety induced the formation of helical 1-dimensional (1-D) fibers which further self-assembled into a gel. Stimuli like heat, stress, pH and light which affect the molecular structure of FA or solubility in the mixed solvents had a pronounced influence on the properties of the gels, such as mechanical properties or bulk phases. A time-dependent oscillatory stress scan indicated that the supramolecular gel had a self-healing property. Without tedious modification routes and addition of alkali metal ions, native FA which served as an efficient building block and super-gelator to build up multi-responsive and self-recovery material was investigated for the first time.",Physical chemistry chemical physics : PCCP,eng,2014,May
"Micelle-Embedded Layer-by-Layer Coating with Catechol and Phenylboronic Acid for Tunable Drug Loading, Sustained Release, Mild Tissue Response, and Selective Cell Fate for Re-endothelialization.","Tunable/sustained drug loading/releasing are of significance in addressing low cytotoxicity, long-term performance, and localized mild healing response in biomedical applications. With an ingenious design, a self-healing sandwiched layer-by-layer (LBL) coating was constructed by using chitosan/heparin as adopted polyelectrolytes with embedding of micelles, in which the chitosan backbone was grafted with catechol and the micelle was modified with exposed phenylboronic acid, endowing the coating with enhanced stability by abundant interactions among coating components (e.g., boric acid ester bond formation, weak intermolecular cross-linking, π-π interactions, and H-bonding). Moreover, rapamycin and atorvastatin calcium were selected as drug candidates and loaded into micelles, followed by drug-releasing behavior study. It was found that the LBL coating maintained a linear growth mode up to 30 cycles, giving a favorable tunability of coating construction and drug loading. The coating could also support sustained release of payloads and provide wild tissue response. With the systematic in vitro and in vivo study, such catechol-phenylboronic acid-enhanced LBL coating with drug loading would also address enhanced antiplatelet adhesion/activation and direct cell fate of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells via tuning of coating cycles and loaded drugs. With modular assembly, such coating indicated potential for achieving enhanced re-endothelialization for vascular implants.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2019,Mar
Evaluating and Modeling the Internal Diffusion Behaviors of Microencapsulated Rejuvenator in Aged Bitumen by FTIR-ATR Tests.,"Microencapsulated rejuvenator has been attracted much attention for self-healing bitumen. The diffusion coefficient is one of the key parameters to estimate the feasibility of rejuvenator to age bitumen. The objective of this research was to evaluate diffusion behaviors of microencapsulated rejuvenator in aged bitumen by a FTIR-ATR method. Various microcapsule samples were mixed in bitumen to form thin films. The core material of microcapsules used as rejuvenator was diphenylsilane (DPS), its fairly specific absorption band at 843 cm<sup>-1</sup> was selected as a marker band to calculate the diffusion coefficient (D). The microstructure parameters, including contents, mean size and mean shell thickness of microcapsules, were considered to understand the diffusion behaviors under different temperatures (20, 30, 40 and 50 °C) in bitumen. The results showed that a larger mean size of microcapsules did not greatly affect the D values under the same temperature. In contrast, a higher mean shell thickness decreased the D values because of the decrement of damage probability of microcapsules under the same content. With the same microcapsule sample in bitumen, the D values presented a trend of linear increase when the content of microcapsules was increased. All these results indicated that the microstructure affected the diffusion behaviors based on the concentration of released rejuvenator. A preliminary model of diffusion behaviors of microencapsulated rejuvenator in bitumen was given based on the Arrhenius equation considering the microstructure of microcapsules, the amount of released rejuvenator and the age degree of bitumen. This model may be a guide to the construction and application of self-healing bitumen using microcapsules.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2016,Nov
"Self-Healable, Adhesive, Anti-Drying, Freezing-Tolerant, and Transparent Conductive Organohydrogel as Flexible Strain Sensor, Triboelectric Nanogenerator, and Skin Barrier.","Conductive hydrogels have attracted tremendous interest in the construction of flexible strain sensors and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) owing to their good stretchability and adjustable properties. Nevertheless, how to simultaneously achieve high transparency, self-healing, adhesion, antibacterial, anti-freezing, anti-drying, and biocompatibility properties through a simple method remains a challenge. Herein, a transparent, freezing-tolerant, and multifunctional organohydrogel (PAOAM-PDO) as electrode for strain sensors and TENGs was constructed through a free radical polymerization in the 1,3-propanediol (PDO)/water binary solvent system, in which oxide sodium alginate, aminated gelatin, acrylic acid, and AlCl<sub>3</sub> were used as raw materials. The obtained PAOAM-PDO exhibited good transparency (>90%), self-healing, adhesiveness, antibacterial property, good conductivity (1.13 S/m), and long-term environmental stability. The introduction of PDO endowed PAOAM-PDO with freezing resistance with a low freezing point of -60 °C, and PAOAM-PDO could serve as a protective skin barrier to prevent frostbite at low temperature. PAOAM-PDO could be assembled as strain sensors to monitor heterogeneous human movements with high strain sensitivity (gauge factor of 7.05, strain = 233%). Meanwhile, PAOAM-PDO could be further fabricated as a TENG with a ""sandwich"" structure in single electrode mode. Moreover, the resulting TENG achieved electrical outputs with simple hand tapping and served as a self-powered device to light light-emitting diodes. This work displays a feasible strategy to build environment-tolerant and multifunctional organohydrogels, which possess potential applications in the wearable electronics and self-powered devices.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,Aug
Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Polymer Nanocomposites with Supramolecular Network Constructed via Functionalized Polymer End-Grafted Nanoparticles.,"Since the proposal of self-healing materials, numerous researchers have focused on exploring their potential applications in flexible sensors, bionic robots, satellites, etc. However, there have been few studies on the relationship between the morphology of the dynamic crosslink network and the comprehensive properties of self-healing polymer nanocomposites (PNCs). In this study, we designed a series of modified nanoparticles with different sphericity (η) to establish a supramolecular network, which provide the self-healing ability to PNCs. We analyzed the relationship between the morphology of the supramolecular network and the mechanical performance and self-healing behavior. We observed that as η increased, the distribution of the supramolecular network became more uniform in most cases. Examination of the segment dynamics of polymer chains showed that the completeness of the supramolecular network significantly hindered the mobility of polymer matrix chains. The mechanical performance and self-healing behavior of the PNCs showed that the supramolecular network mainly contributed to the mechanical performance, while the self-healing efficiency was dominated by the variation of η. We observed that appropriate grafting density is the proper way to effectively enhance the mechanical and self-healing performance of PNCs. This study provides a unique guideline for designing and fabricating self-healing PNCs with modified Nanoparticles (NPs).",Polymers,eng,2023,Jul

Does a High Amount of Unhydrated Portland Cement Ensure an Effective Autogenous Self-Healing of Mortar?,"It is commonly accepted that the autogenous self-healing of concrete is mainly controlled by the hydration of Portland cement and its extent depends on the availability of anhydrous particles. High-performance (HPCs) and ultra-high performance concretes (UHPCs) incorporating very high amounts of cement and having a low water-to-cement ratio reach the hydration degree of only 70-50%. Consequently, the presence of a large amount of unhydrated cement should result in excellent autogenous self-healing. The main aim of this study was to examine whether this commonly accepted hypothesis was correct. The study included tests performed on UHPC and mortars with a low water-to-cement ratio and high cement content. Additionally, aging effects were verified on 12-month-old UHPC samples. Analysis was conducted on the crack surfaces and inside of the cracks. The results strongly indicated that the formation of a dense microstructure and rapidly hydrating, freshly exposed anhydrous cement particles could significantly limit or even hinder the self-healing process. The availability of anhydrous cement appeared not to guarantee development of a highly effective healing process.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2019,Oct
"Dynamic covalent chemistry approaches toward macrocycles, molecular cages, and polymers.","The current research in the field of dynamic covalent chemistry includes the study of dynamic covalent reactions, catalysts, and their applications. Unlike noncovalent interactions utilized in supramolecular chemistry, the formation/breakage of covalent bonding has slower kinetics and usually requires the aid of a catalyst. Catalytic systems that enable efficient thermodynamic equilibrium are thus essential. In this Account, we describe the development of efficient catalysts for alkyne metathesis, and discuss the application of dynamic covalent reactions (mainly imine, olefin, and alkyne metathesis) in the development of organic functional materials. Alkyne metathesis is an emerging dynamic covalent reaction that offers robust and linear acetylene linkages. By introducing a podand motif into the catalyst ligand design, we have developed a series of highly active and robust alkyne metathesis catalysts, which, for the first time, enabled the one-step covalent assembly of ethynylene-linked functional molecular cages. Imine chemistry and olefin metathesis are among the most well-established reversible reactions, and have also been our main synthetic tools. Various shape-persistent macrocycles and covalent organic polyhedrons have been efficiently constructed in one-step through dynamic imine chemistry and olefin metathesis. The geometrical features and solubilizing groups of the building blocks as well as the reaction kinetics have significant effect on the outcome of a covalent assembly process. More recently, we explored the orthogonality of imine and olefin metatheses, and successfully synthesized heterosequenced macrocycles and molecular cages through one-pot orthogonal dynamic covalent chemistry. In addition to discrete molecular architectures, functional polymeric materials can also be accessed through dynamic covalent reactions. Defect-free solution-processable conjugated polyaryleneethynylenes and polydiacetylenes have been prepared through alkyne metathesis polymerization. We prepared imine- or ethynylene-linked porous polymer networks, which exhibit permanent porosity with high specific surface areas. Our most recent contribution is the discovery of a recyclable polyimine material whose self-healing can be activated simply by heating or water treatment. The facile access to complex functional organic molecules through dynamic covalent chemistry has allowed us to explore their exciting applications in gas adsorption/separation, host-guest chemistry, and nanocomposite fabrication. It is clear that there are significant opportunities for improved dynamic covalent systems and their more widespread applications in materials science.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2014,May

Biomimetic polymeric superamphiphobic surfaces: their fabrication and applications.,"Numerous research studies have contributed to the development of mature superamphiphobic systems. In this review, we summarize the characterization of surface wettability, the fabrication techniques and the multifunctional applications of polymeric superamphiphobic surfaces inspired from nature. Regarding construction techniques, three types of technology routes, namely pre-roughening and post-modifying, pre-modifying and pre-roughening, and in situ one-step construction, will be successively discussed. The polymeric surfaces produced by these methods not only possess superamphiphobicity but also have many applications, such as self-cleaning, self-healing, anti-icing, and transparency. However, few of these surfaces have been scaled up and utilized for applications due to specific difficulties that must be resolved, which will provide potential directions for future research. Finally, the challenges and further outlook of super-antiwetting surfaces are discussed in this review.","Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",eng,2019,Sep
"Liquid-Free, Self-Repairable, Recyclable, and Highly Stretchable Colorless Solid Ionic Conductive Elastomers for Strain/Temperature Sensors.","Solid-state ionic conductive elastomers (ICEs) can fundamentally overcome the disadvantages of hydrogels and ionogels (their liquid components tend to leak or evaporate), and are considered to be ideal materials for flexible ionic sensors. In this study, a liquid-free ionic polyurethane (PU) type conductive elastomer (ICE-2) was synthesized and studied. The PU type matrix with microphase separation endowed ICE-2 with excellent mechanical versatility. The disulfide bond exchange reaction in the hard phase and intermolecular hydrogen bonds contributed to damage repairing ability. ICE-2 exhibited good ionic conductivity (2.86×10<sup>-6</sup>  S/cm), high transparency (average transmittance >89 %, 400~800 nm), excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 3.06 MPa, elongation at break of 1760 %, and fracture energy of 14.98 kJ/m<sup>2</sup> ), appreciable self-healing ability (healing efficiency >90 %), satisfactory environmental stability, and outstanding recyclability. The sensor constructed by ICE-2 could not only realize the perception of temperature changes, but also accurately and sensitively detect various human activities, including joint movements and micro-expression changes.

The Mechanical Properties of Poly (Urea-Formaldehyde) Incorporated with Nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> by Molecular Dynamics Simulation.,"Self-healing materials can promote the sustainable reuse of resources. Poly (urea-formaldehyde) (PUF) microcapsules can be incorporated into dielectric materials for self-healing. However, the mechanical properties of PUF microcapsules need to be improved due to insufficient hardness. In this paper, PUF models incorporated with nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> of different filler concentrations (0, 2.6, 3.7, 5.3, 6.7, 7.9 wt.%) were designed. The density, the fractional free volume, and the mechanical properties of the PUF-SiO<sub>2</sub> models were analyzed at an atomic level based on molecular dynamics simulation. The interfacial interaction model of PUF on the SiO<sub>2</sub> surface was also constructed to further investigate the interaction mechanisms. The results showed that the incorporation of nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> had a significant effect on the mechanical properties of PUF. Density increased, fractional free volume decreased, and mechanical properties of the PUF materials were gradually enhanced with the increase of nano-SiO<sub>2</sub> concentration. This trend was also confirmed by experimental tests. By analyzing the internal mechanism of the PUF-SiO<sub>2</sub> interfacial interaction, it was found that hydrogen bonds play a major role in the interaction between PUF and nano-SiO<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, hydrogen bonds can be formed between the polar atoms of the PUF chain and the hydroxyl groups (-OH) as well as O atoms on the surface of SiO<sub>2</sub>. Hydrogen bonds interactions are involved in adsorption of PUF chains on the SiO<sub>2</sub> surface, reducing the distance between PUF chains and making the system denser, thus enhancing the mechanical properties of PUF materials.",Polymers,eng,2019,Sep
Mechanical Characterization of High-Performance Steel-Fiber Reinforced Cement Composites with Self-Healing Effect.,"The crack self-healing behavior of high-performance steel-fiber reinforced cement composites (HPSFRCs) was investigated. High-strength deformed steel fibers were employed in a high strength mortar with very fine silica sand to decreasing the crack width by generating higher interfacial bond strength. The width of micro-cracks, strongly affected by the type of fiber and sand, clearly produced the effects on the self-healing behavior. The use of fine silica sand in HPSFRCs with high strength deformed steel fibers successfully led to rapid healing owing to very fine cracks with width less than 20 µm. The use of very fine silica sand instead of normal sand produced 17%-19% higher tensile strength and 51%-58% smaller width of micro-cracks.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2014,Jan
Thermally Reversible Cross-Linking of Recyclable Polyamide Materials Based on Schiff Base and Diels-Alder Reactions.,"Recyclability of cross-link polymer materials is essential to alleviate environmental pollution caused by discarded or damaged polymers.

According to the dynamic oscillatory data, the hydrogel exhibits markedly enhanced stiffness compared with the GPCD-free one (both G' and G"" values are almost twice as high as those of the original GPCD-free hydrogel) due to the introduction of the inorganic gold nanoparticles. This hybrid supramolecular polymeric hydrogel has a rapid and excellent self-healing property (only about 1 min, and the G' and G"" of the self-healed hydrogel almost turned back to their original levels after 1 hour) in air (without adding any solvent or additive).","Chemistry, an Asian journal",eng,2015,Nov
Crack Width Estimation of Mortar Specimen Using Gas Diffusion Experiment.,"Maintenance of structures using self-healing concrete technologies has recently been actively studied. However, unlike the technological development of self-healing concrete, research focused on evaluating the self-healing performance is insufficient. Although water permeability experiments are widely used, the reliability of the test results may be reduced due to the viscosity of water and the possibility of elution of material inside the specimen. In this study, we propose a gas diffusion test for estimating the crack width and eventually for application to evaluation of the self-healing performance. The results verified that the proposed method can be effectively applied to the estimation of crack width.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2019,Sep
Multi-stimulus Response Behavior of Biomimetic Autocrine Waxy Materials for Potential Self-Constructing Surface Microstructures.,"Many functions of terrestrial plant leaves rely on the regenerable epidermal wax layer. Biomimetic autocrine waxy materials (AWMs) inspired by renewable epidermal waxes are attracting increasing attention. However, the growth properties of the wax layer remain unclear, limiting the development of this promising material. This work focuses on the stimulated growth characteristics and microstructural regulation methods of the waxy layers. It is found that the wax layers exhibit a corresponding behavior of changing their surface micromorphology under force, heat, solvents, and other stimuli during the self-growth process, and as a result of which, various types of fine surface microstructures such as grids, rings, stripes, pattern copying, and printing can be self-built on their surfaces. The composition of the surface autocrine wax layer changes with the autocrine time, and this finding may be useful for the separation and purification of alkane mixtures. In addition, the surface wax layer possesses the ability to self-heal and strengthen itself at the damage site after being stimulated by injury, similar to the damage-response behavior of a bark surface. Such multi-stimulus response behavior described here provides a platform for the discovery of more functional materials and microstructural self-construction techniques and can also serve as a basis for their applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,Oct
Synergistic Covalent and Supramolecular Polymers for Mechanically Robust but Dynamic Materials.,"Nature has engineered delicate synergistic covalent and supramolecular polymers (CSPs) to achieve advanced life functions, such as the thin filaments that assist in muscle contraction.

Here, we report an artificial CSP system to illustrate the integration of a covalent polymer (CP) and a supramolecular polymer (SP) in a synergistic fashion, along with the emergence of notable mechanical and dynamic properties which are unattainable when the two polymers are formed individually. The synergistic effect relies on the peculiar network structures of the SP and CPs, which endow the resultant CSPs with overall improved mechanical performance in terms of the stiffness, strength, stretchability, toughness, and elastic recovery. Moreover, the dynamic properties of the SP, including self-healing, stimuli-responsiveness, and reprocessing, are also retained in the CSPs, thus leading to their application as programmable and tunable materials.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),eng,2020,Jul

Synthesis of doubly ethyl-bridged bis(p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene) and its supramolecular polymerization with viologen dimer.,"A water-soluble supramolecular polymer with a high degree of polymerization and viscosity has been constructed based on the strong host-guest interaction between p-sulfonatocalix[4]arenes (SC4As) and viologen. A homoditopic doubly ethyl-bridged bis(p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene) (d-SC4A) was prepared and its binding behavior towards methyl viologen compared with the singly ethyl-bridged bis(p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene) (s-SC4A) by NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry. By employing a viologen dimer (bisMV(4+)) as the homoditopic guest, two linear AA/BB-type supramolecular polymers, d-SC4A⊃bisMV(4+) and s-SC4A⊃bisMV(4+), were successfully constructed. Compared with s-SC4A⊃bisMV(4+), d-SC4A⊃bisMV(4+) shows much higher solubility and viscosity, and has also been characterized by viscosity, diffusion-ordered NMR spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and atomic force microscopy measurements. Furthermore, the polymer is responsive to electrostimulus as viologen is electroactive, which was studied by cyclic voltammetry.

Liquid-repellent and self-repairing lubricant-grafted surfaces constructed by thiol-ene click chemistry using activated hollow silica as the lubricant reservoir.,"The development of robust, stain-resistant, and self-healing liquid-repellent surfaces is a common aspiration of both consumer and industrial applications, but the existing methods suffer from limitations, such as complicated procedures, weak mechanical durability and substrate dependency. In this work, a lubricant-grafted slippery surface (LGSS) was prepared by grafting vinyl-terminated polydimethylsiloxane (Vi-PDMS) onto various substrates coated with sulfhydryl-modified hollow mesoporous silica (SH-HMS) through a thiol-ene click reaction. The uniform and intact lubricant layer can effectively decrease the absorption of the polysaccharide and protein, exhibiting superior antifouling properties. Notably, the hollow structure of SH-HMS could significantly increase the oil grafting capacity of the slippery surface from 0.013 g/cm<sup>2</sup> to 0.027 g/cm<sup>2</sup> compared with the surface constructed by solid silica. By virtue of the strong covalent bond forces between the lubricant oil and surfaces, the obtained LGSS exhibited robust liquid repellency when subjected to high/low temperature, ultraviolet irradiation and water impact. Moreover, the liquid-repellent LGSS exhibited good self-repairing performance owing to the directional migration of the Vi-PDMS chain segment from the hollow capsule to the surface through the mesoporous channels under heating treatment. Therefore, such a newly developed strategy for constructing liquid-repellent coatings on various substrates with self-repairing properties has the potential to promote the advancement of interfacial antifouling materials and exhibit tremendous potential for consumer and industrial applications.",Journal of colloid and interface science,eng,2021,Mar
Theoretical Model of Time-Temperature Superposition Principle of the Self-Healing Kinetics of Supramolecular Polymer Nanocomposites.,"The matrix-free polymer nanocomposites (PNCs) formed by polymer-grafted nanoparticles(NPs) gain enormous attention due to their controllable morphology and robust properties. Herein, through molecular dynamics simulation, such PNCs are successfully constructed, and the dispersion state of the NPs can be tailored by varying the grafting density. By manipulating the interaction strength between the end groups of the grafted polymer chains, the tensile fracture behavior and the chain orientation are examined. It is revealed that both of them fall down at large strain because of the propagation of the cavities. By probing the self-healing kinetics at various self-healing temperature and time, a time-temperature superposition principle, similar to the Williams, Landel and Ferry equation, is proposed. These results could provide some fundamental guidelines for the design and fabrication of high performance PNCs with excellent self-healing functionality.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2018,Oct
Sacrificial bonds and hidden length: unraveling molecular mesostructures in tough materials.,"Sacrificial bonds and hidden length in structural molecules and composites have been found to greatly increase the fracture toughness of biomaterials by providing a reversible, molecular-scale energy-dissipation mechanism. This mechanism relies on the energy, of order 100 eV, needed to reduce entropy and increase enthalpy as molecular segments are stretched after being released by the breaking of weak bonds, called sacrificial bonds. This energy is relatively large compared to the energy needed to break the polymer backbone, of order a few eV. In many biological cases, the breaking of sacrificial bonds has been found to be reversible, thereby additionally providing a ""self-healing"" property to the material. Due to the nanoscopic nature of this mechanism, single molecule force spectroscopy using an atomic force microscope has been a useful tool to investigate this mechanism. Especially when investigating natural molecular constructs, force versus distance curves quickly become very complicated. In this work we propose various types of sacrificial bonds, their combination, and how they appear in single molecule force spectroscopy measurements. We find that by close analysis of the force spectroscopy curves, additional information can be obtained about the molecules and their bonds to the native constructs.",Biophysical journal,eng,2006,Feb
Sustained local drug delivery from a radiopaque implanted reservoir.,"A new polymeric biomaterial that contains covalently bound iodine, and is therefore radiopaque, was used to construct a sustained local drug-delivery device. A polymeric wall was designed to be porous (i.e., passage of low-molecular-weight molecules across the wall is possible), self-healing, and biocompatible. Once implanted, the sphere cavity can be filled and refilled with a concentrated solution of a (cytostatic) drug, which is subsequently released by slow diffusion into the tissue region surrounding the sphere. This principle of sustained local drug delivery is shown by a series of in vitro experiments on the release of 5-fluorouracil, and in vivo animal experiments, using x-ray fluoroscopic and scintigraphic techniques.",Nature biotechnology,eng,1998,Feb
Robust and self-healable nanocomposite physical hydrogel facilitated by the synergy of ternary crosslinking points in a single network.,"Acrylamide (AM) and a small amount of stearyl methacrylate (C18) hydrophobic monomer copolymerize to graft on the surface of vinyl hybrid silica nanoparticles (VSNPs), forming nanobrush gelators, thereby constructing ternarily crosslinked nanocomposite physical hydrogels (TC-NCP gels). The TC-NCP gel is composed of a single network ternarily crosslinked by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions among the grafting polymer chains as physical cross-linking points and thus the polymer grafted VSNPs as analogous covalent crosslinking points. Under stretching, the physical crosslinking points successively break to gradually dissipate energy and then recombine to homogenize the network. During the stretching process, the polymer chains grafted VSNPs can homogenize the stress distribution as transferring centers. The synergy of the ternary crosslinking points leads the TC-NCP gels to dissipate more energy and redistribute the stress more effectively when compared with hydrogels dually crosslinked by both hydrogen bonds and VSNPs as analogous covalent crosslinking points (without hydrophobic interactions) and by both hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions (without VSNPs). As a result, the TC-NCP gels demonstrate remarkably improved mechanical properties, including tensile strength of 256 kPa, stretch ratio at break of 28.23 and toughness of 1.92 MJ m<sup>-3</sup> at a water content of 90%. Pure shear test shows that the TC-NCP gel is able to resist notch propagation by micro-crack development from the notch tip to the whole gel network and has a high tearing energy of 1.21 × 10<sup>4</sup> J m<sup>-2</sup>. The dynamic nature of the network endows the TC-NCP gels with excellent self-healing ability. The results evidently indicate that constructing a single gel network with hierarchical crosslinking points is a versatile method to fabricate robust hydrogels.",Journal of materials chemistry.

Constructing thin polythiophene film composed of aligned lamellae via controlled solvent vapor treatment.,Thin poly(3-butylthiophene) (P3BT) film composed of aligned lamellae attached to the edge of the original film has been achieved via a controlled solvent vapor treatment (C-SVT) method. The polarized optical microscopy operated at both single-polarization and cross-polarization modes has been used to investigate the alignment of the fiber-like lamellae. A numerical simulation method is used to quantitatively calculate angle distributions of the lamellae deviated from the film growth direction. Prepatterned P3BT film edge acts as nuclei which densely initialize subsequent crystal growth by exhausting the materials transported from the partially dissolved film. The growth of new film upon crystallization is actually a self-healing process where the two-dimensional geometric confinement is mainly responsible for this parallel alignment of P3BT crystals. The solvent vapor pressure should be carefully chosen so as to induce crystal growth but avoid liquid instability which will destroy the continuity of the film. The combination of microfabrication technique and C-SVT method provides a novel method to fabricate hierarchical structure within thin polymer film with multiscale morphology via utilizing both up-bottom and bottom-up approaches.,Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids,eng,2009,Apr
Enhancing cartilage repair with optimized supramolecular hydrogel-based scaffold and pulsed electromagnetic field.,"Functional tissue engineering strategies provide innovative approach for the repair and regeneration of damaged cartilage. Hydrogel is widely used because it could provide rapid defect filling and proper structure support, and is biocompatible for cell aggregation and matrix deposition. Efforts have been made to seek suitable scaffolds for cartilage tissue engineering. Here Alg-DA/Ac-β-CD/gelatin hydrogel was designed with the features of physical and chemical multiple crosslinking and self-healing properties. Gelation time, swelling ratio, biodegradability and biocompatibility of the hydrogels were systematically characterized, and the injectable self-healing adhesive hydrogel were demonstrated to exhibit ideal properties for cartilage repair. Furthermore, the new hydrogel design introduces a pre-gel state before photo-crosslinking, where increased viscosity and decreased fluidity allow the gel to remain in a semi-solid condition. This granted multiple administration routes to the hydrogels, which brings hydrogels the ability to adapt to complex clinical situations. Pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMF) have been recognized as a promising solution to various health problems owing to their noninvasive properties and therapeutic potentials. PEMF treatment offers a better clinical outcome with fewer, if any, side effects, and wildly used in musculoskeletal tissue repair. Thereby we propose PEMF as an effective biophysical stimulation to be 4th key element in cartilage tissue engineering. In this study, the as-prepared Alg-DA/Ac-β-CD/gelatin hydrogels were utilized in the rat osteochondral defect model, and the potential application of PEMF in cartilage tissue engineering were investigated.

Self-healable nanocellulose composite hydrogels combining multiple dynamic bonds for drug delivery.,"Herein, we developed two nanocomposite polysaccharide hydrogels TPP-CNC and TPP-CNF via simple mixing method, which were constructed with multiple dynamic bonds. The microstructural features, mechanical properties, rheological properties, healable ability and biocompatibility of the complex hydrogels were evaluated. The TPP-CNC and TPP-CNF complex hydrogels exhibited higher tensile strength than pure polysaccharide hydrogel, from ~259 KPa to ~890 KPa and ~910 KPa, respectively, that was attributed to the contribution of ionic crosslinked network and hydrogen bonds. In addition, the hydrogels indicated superior fatigue resistance and high energy dissipation ratio during loading-unloading tests because of the physical sacrifice bonds, which also decreased the self-healing time at room temperature (~15 min). More importantly, the drug loaded nanocomposite hydrogels showed sustained release, reduction burst release, increased release under acidic environment, and the drug release kinetics belonged to Fickian diffusion mechanism. Therefore, the nanocellulose polysaccharide hydrogels have the highly promising to explore as biomaterials for drug delivery.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2022,Apr
A Natural Glycyrrhizic Acid-Tailored Light-Responsive Gelator.,"The construction of stimuli-responsive materials by using naturally occurring molecules as building blocks has received increasing attention owing to their bioavailability, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. Herein, a symmetrical azobenzene-functionalized natural glycyrrhizic acid (trans-GAG) was synthesized and could form stable supramolecular gels in DMSO/H<sub>2</sub> O and MeOH/H<sub>2</sub> O. Owing to trans-cis isomerization, this gel exhibited typical light-responsive behavior that led to a reversible gel-sol transition accompanied by a variation in morphology and rheology. Additionally, this trans-GAG gel displayed a distinct injectable self-healing property and outstanding biocompatibility. This work provides a simple yet rational strategy to fabricate stimuli-responsive materials from naturally occurring, eco-friendly molecules.","Chemistry, an Asian journal",eng,2018,May
A Review of Smart Lubricant-Infused Surfaces for Droplet Manipulation.,"The nepenthes-inspired lubricant-infused surface (LIS) is emerging as a novel repellent surface with self-healing, self-cleaning, pressure stability and ultra-slippery properties. Recently, stimuli-responsive materials to construct a smart LIS have broadened the application of LIS for droplet manipulation, showing great promise in microfluidics. This review mainly focuses on the recent developments towards the droplet manipulation on LIS with different mechanisms induced by various external stimuli, including thermo, light, electric, magnetism, and mechanical force. First, the droplet condition on LIS, determined by the properties of the droplet, the lubricant and substrate, is illustrated. Droplet manipulation via altering the droplet regime realized by different mechanisms, such as varying slipperiness, electrostatic force and wettability, is discussed. Moreover, some applications on droplet manipulation employed in various filed, including microreactors, microfluidics, etc., are also presented. Finally, a summary of this work and possible future research directions for the transport of droplets on smart LIS are outlined to promote the development of this field.","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Mar
Photoregulative phase change biomaterials showing thermodynamic and mchanical stabilities.,"Azobenzenes are great photochromic molecules for switching the physical properties of various materials <i>via trans</i>-<i>cis</i> isomerization. However, the UV light resulted <i>cis</i>-azobenzene is metastable and thermodynamically gets back to <i>trans</i>-azobenzene after ceasing UV irradiation, which causes an unwanted property change of azobenzene-containing materials. Additionally, thermal and mechanical conditions would accelerate this process dramatically. In this present work, a new type of azobenzene-containing surfactant is designed for the fabrication of photoresponsive phase change biomaterials. With a ""locked"" <i>cis</i>-azobenzene conformation, the resulting biomaterials could maintain their disordered state after ceasing UV light, which exhibit great resistance to thermal and piezo conditions. Interestingly, the ""locked"" <i>cis</i>-azobenzene could be unlocked by Vis light in high efficiency, which opens a new way for the design of phase change materials only responding to light. By showing stable <i>cis</i>-azobenzene maintained physical state, the newly fabricated biomaterials provide new potential for the construction of advanced materials, like self-healing materials, with less use of long time UV irradiation for maintaining their disordered states.",Nanoscale,eng,2022,Jan
From prevention to diagnosis and treatment: Biomedical applications of metal nanoparticle-hydrogel composites.,"Recent advances in biomaterials integrate metal nanoparticles with hydrogels to generate composite materials that exhibit new or improved properties. By precisely controlling the composition, arrangement and interactions of their constituents, these hybrid materials facilitate biomedical applications through myriad approaches. In this work we seek to highlight three popular frameworks for designing metal nanoparticle-hydrogel hybrid materials for biomedical applications. In the first approach, the properties of metal nanoparticles are incorporated into a hydrogel matrix such that the composite is selectively responsive to stimuli such as light and magnetic flux, enabling precisely activated therapeutics and self-healing biomaterials. The second approach mediates the dynamic reorganization of metal nanoparticles based on environment-directed changes in hydrogel structure, leading to chemosensing, microbial and viral detection, and drug-delivery capabilities. In the third approach, the hydrogel matrix spatially arranges metal nanoparticles to produce metamaterials or passively enhance nanoparticle properties to generate improved substrates for biomedical applications including tissue engineering and wound healing. This article reviews the construction, properties and biomedical applications of metal nanoparticle-hydrogel composites, with a focus on how they help to prevent, diagnose and treat diseases. Discussion includes how the composites lead to new or improved properties, how current biomedical research leverages these properties and the emerging directions in this growing field.",Acta biomaterialia,eng,2021,Mar
Self-healable castor oil-based waterborne polyurethane/MXene film with outstanding electromagnetic interference shielding effectiveness and excellent shape memory performance.,"Recently, the increasing demands of the portable devices and flexible electronics have caused lots of electromagnetic wave pollution. MXene, a novel two-dimensional material, was considered as a promising two-dimensional material for preparing flexible electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding films. Herein, we firstly synthesized a series of flexible and self-healable EMI shielding waterborne polyurethane (ADWPU) films by mechanically blending with Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> (ADWPU-T). Interestingly, the self-assembling between ADWPU and Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> constructed a tunable analogical structure providing reflection-absorption-multiple reflection shielding mechanism. Furthermore, the ADWPU-T emulsions were prepared from castor oil which is a low-cost and eco-friendly biomass polyol. The chain extender 2-aminophenyl disulfide endow a reversible dynamic polymer network which leading to shape memory performance (45°C heat treatment) and self-healing ability (60°C, 5 min healed). Above all, these multifunctional flexible films also exhibited outstanding EMI shielding performance (51.37 dB) and performed less decrement after 200 times bending and 80°C aging test for five days. Therefore, this work would provide a novel promising method for preparing responsive electromagnetic interference shielding products and smart electronic devices.",Journal of colloid and interface science,eng,2021,Apr
Thermoresponsive Gels.,"Thermoresponsive gelling materials constructed from natural and synthetic polymers can be used to provide triggered action and therefore customised products such as drug delivery and regenerative medicine types as well as for other industries. Some materials give Arrhenius-type viscosity changes based on coil to globule transitions. Others produce more counterintuitive responses to temperature change because of agglomeration induced by enthalpic or entropic drivers. Extensive covalent crosslinking superimposes complexity of response and the upper and lower critical solution temperatures can translate to critical volume temperatures for these swellable but insoluble gels. Their structure and volume response confer advantages for actuation though they lack robustness. Dynamic covalent bonding has created an intermediate category where shape moulding and self-healing variants are useful for several platforms. Developing synthesis methodology-for example, Reversible Addition Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT) and Atomic Transfer Radical Polymerisation (ATRP)-provides an almost infinite range of materials that can be used for many of these gelling systems. For those that self-assemble into micelle systems that can gel, the upper and lower critical solution temperatures (UCST and LCST) are analogous to those for simpler dispersible polymers. However, the tuned hydrophobic-hydrophilic balance plus the introduction of additional pH-sensitivity and, for instance, thermochromic response, open the potential for coupled mechanisms to create complex drug targeting effects at the cellular level.","Gels (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2017,Jan
Metal organic frameworks (MOFs) as multifunctional nanoplatform for anticorrosion surfaces and coatings.,"Corrosion of metallic materials is a long-standing problem in many engineering fields. Various organic coatings have been widely applied in anticorrosion of metallic materials over the past decades. However, the protective performance of many organic coatings is limited due to the undesirable local failure of the coatings caused by micro-pores and cracks in the coating matrix. Recently, metal organic frameworks (MOFs)-based surfaces and coatings (MOFBSCs) have exhibited great potential in constructing protective materials on metallic substrates with efficient and durable anticorrosion performance. The tailorable porous structure, flexible composition, numerous active sites, and controllable release properties of MOFs make them an ideal platform for developing various protective functionalities, such as self-healing property, superhydrophobicity, and physical barrier against corrosion media. MOFs-based anticorrosion surfaces and coatings can be divided into two categories: the composite surfaces/coatings using MOFs-based passive/active nanofillers and the surfaces/coatings using MOFs as functional substrate support. In this work, the state-of-the-art fabrication strategies of the MOFBSCs are systematically reviewed. The anticorrosion mechanisms of MOFBSCs and functions of the MOFs in the coating matrix are discussed accordingly. Additionally, we highlight both traditional and emerging electrochemical techniques for probing protective performances and mechanisms of MOFBSCs. The remaining challenging issues and perspectives are also discussed.",Advances in colloid and interface science,eng,2022,Jul
Rationally designed synthetic protein hydrogels with predictable mechanical properties.,"Designing synthetic protein hydrogels with tailored mechanical properties similar to naturally occurring tissues is an eternal pursuit in tissue engineering and stem cell and cancer research. However, it remains challenging to correlate the mechanical properties of protein hydrogels with the nanomechanics of individual building blocks. Here we use single-molecule force spectroscopy, protein engineering and theoretical modeling to prove that the mechanical properties of protein hydrogels are predictable based on the mechanical hierarchy of the cross-linkers and the load-bearing modules at the molecular level. These findings provide a framework for rationally designing protein hydrogels with independently tunable elasticity, extensibility, toughness and self-healing. Using this principle, we demonstrate the engineering of self-healable muscle-mimicking hydrogels that can significantly dissipate energy through protein unfolding. We expect that this principle can be generalized for the construction of protein hydrogels with customized mechanical properties for biomedical applications.",Nature communications,eng,2018,Feb
Chitosan@Puerarin hydrogel for accelerated wound healing in diabetic subjects by miR-29ab1 mediated inflammatory axis suppression.,"Wound healing is one of the major global health concerns in patients with diabetes. Overactivation of pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages is associated with delayed wound healing in diabetes. miR-29ab1 plays a critical role in diabetes-related macrophage inflammation. Hence, inhibition of inflammation and regulation of miR-29 expression have been implicated as new points for skin wound healing. In this study, the traditional Chinese medicine, puerarin, was introduced to construct an injectable and self-healing chitosan@puerarin (C@P) hydrogel. The C@P hydrogel promoted diabetic wound healing and accelerated angiogenesis, which were related to the inhibition of the miR-29 mediated inflammation response. Compared to healthy subjects, miR-29a and miR-29b1 were ectopically increased in the skin wound of the diabetic model, accompanied by upregulated M1-polarization, and elevated levels of IL-1β and TNF-α. Further evaluations by miR-29ab1 knockout mice exhibited superior wound healing and attenuated inflammation. The present results suggested that miR-29ab1 is essential for diabetic wound healing by regulating the inflammatory response. Suppression of miR-29ab1 by the C@P hydrogel has the potential for improving medical approaches for wound repair.",Bioactive materials,eng,2023,Jan
Engineering responsive polymer building blocks with host-guest molecular recognition for functional applications.,"CONSPECTUS: All living organisms and soft matter are intrinsically responsive and adaptive to external stimuli. Inspired by this fact, tremendous effort aiming to emulate subtle responsive features exhibited by nature has spurred the invention of a diverse range of responsive polymeric materials. Conventional stimuli-responsive polymers are constructed via covalent bonds and can undergo reversible or irreversible changes in chemical structures, physicochemical properties, or both in response to a variety of external stimuli. They have been imparted with a variety of emerging applications including drug and gene delivery, optical sensing and imaging, diagnostics and therapies, smart coatings and textiles, and tissue engineering. On the other hand, in comparison with molecular chemistry held by covalent bonds, supramolecular chemistry built on weak and reversible noncovalent interactions has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy for materials fabrication due to its facile accessibility, extraordinary reversibility and adaptivity, and potent applications in diverse fields. Typically involving more than one type of noncovalent interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding, metal coordination, hydrophobic association, electrostatic interactions, van der Waals forces, and π-π stacking), host-guest recognition refers to the formation of supramolecular inclusion complexes between two or more entities connected together in a highly controlled and cooperative manner. The inherently reversible and adaptive nature of host-guest molecular recognition chemistry, stemming from multiple noncovalent interactions, has opened up a new platform to construct novel types of stimuli-responsive materials. The introduction of host-guest chemistry not only enriches the realm of responsive materials but also confers them with promising new applications. Most intriguingly, the integration of responsive polymer building blocks with host-guest recognition motifs will endow the former with further broadened responsiveness to external stimuli and accordingly more sophisticated functions. In this Account, we summarize recent progress in the field of responsive polymeric materials containing host-guest recognition motifs with selected examples and highlight their versatile functional applications, whereas small molecule-oriented host-guest supramolecular systems are excluded. We demonstrate how the introduction of host-guest chemistry into conventional polymer systems can modulate their responsive modes to external stimuli. Moreover, the responsive specificity and selectivity of polymeric systems can also be inherited from the host-guest recognition motifs, and these features provide extra advantages in terms of function integration. The following discussions are categorized in terms of design and functions, namely, host-guest chemistry toward the fabrication of responsive polymers and assemblies, optical sensing and imaging, drug and gene delivery, and self-healing materials. A concluding remark on future developments is also presented. We wish this prosperous field would incur more original and evolutionary ideas and benefit fundamental research and our daily life in a more convenient way.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2014,Jul
Self-Healing Heterometallic Supramolecular Polymers Constructed by Hierarchical Assembly of Triply Orthogonal Interactions with Tunable Photophysical Properties.,"Here, we present a method for the building of new bicyclic heterometallic cross-linked supramolecular polymers by hierarchical unification of three types of orthogonal noncovalent interactions, including platinum(II)-pyridine coordination-driven self-assembly, zinc-terpyridine complex, and host-guest interactions. The platinum-pyridine coordination provides the primary driving force to form discrete rhomboidal metallacycles. The assembly does not interfere with the zinc-terpyridine complexes, which link the discrete metallacycles into linear supramolecular polymers, and the conjugation length is extended upon the formation of the zinc-terpyridine complexes, which red-shifts the absorption and emission spectra. Finally, host-guest interactions via bis-ammonium salt binding to the benzo-21-crown-7 (B21C7) groups on the platinum acceptors afford the cross-linked supramolecular polymers. By continuous increase of the concentration of the supramolecular polymer to a relatively high level, supramolecular polymer gel is obtained, which exhibits self-healing properties and reversible gel-sol transitions stimulated by various external stimuli, including temperature, K<sup>+</sup>, and cyclen. Moreover, the photophysical properties of the supramolecular polymers could be effectively tuned by varying the substituents of the precursor ligands.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,eng,2019,Nov
Copper-Hydrazide Coordinated Multifunctional Hyaluronan Hydrogels for Infected Wound Healing.,"Bacterial infection and delayed healing are two major obstacles in cutaneous wound management, and developing multifunctional hydrogels with antibacterial and prohealing capabilities presents a promising strategy to dress wounds. However, the simple and facile fabrication of such hydrogel dressings remains challenging. Herein, we report the first observation on hydrazide-metal coordination crosslinking that is utilized to successfully construct a series of hyaluronan (HA)-metal hydrogels by mixing hydrazided HA and metal ion solutions. Considering the antibacterial, prohealing, and proangiogenic properties of HA and Cu(II), as a proof of principle, a HA-Cu hydrogel was systematically investigated as a wound dressing. Surprisingly, the hydrazide-Cu(II) coordination was dynamic in nature and imparted the HA-Cu hydrogel with physicochemical multifunctions, including spontaneous self-healing, shear-thinning injectability, reversible pH/redox/ion pair triple responsiveness, etc. Moreover, the HA-Cu hydrogel exhibited a robust broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and could significantly accelerate infectious wound healing. Impressively, glutathione-triggered hydroxyl radical generation further potentiated wound healing, providing a paradigm for on-demand antibacterial activity enhancement. Hence, the HA-Cu hydrogel is a clinically applicable ""smart"" dressing for multi-scenario wound healing. We envision that the simple and versatile coordination approach opens up a new avenue to develop multifunctional hydrogels and shows great potential in frontier fields, such as biomedicine, wearable devices, and soft robots.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Apr
An injectable conductive hydrogel restores electrical transmission at myocardial infarct site to preserve cardiac function and enhance repair.,"Myocardial infarction (MI) leads to massive cardiomyocyte death and deposition of collagen fibers. This fibrous tissue disrupts electrical signaling in the myocardium, leading to cardiac systolic and diastolic dysfunction, as well as arrhythmias. Conductive hydrogels are a promising therapeutic strategy for MI. Here, we prepared a highly water-soluble conductive material (GP) by grafting polypyrrole (PPy) onto non-conductive gelatin. This component was added to the gel system formed by the Schiff base reaction between oxidized xanthan gum (OXG) and gelatin to construct an injectable conductive hydrogel. The prepared self-healing OGGP3 (3 wt% GP) hydrogel had good biocompatibility, elastic modulus, and electrical conductivity that matched the natural heart. The prepared biomaterials were injected into the rat myocardial scar tissue 2 days after MI. We found that the cardiac function of the rats treated with OGGP3 was improved, making it more difficult to induce arrhythmias. The electrical resistivity of myocardial fibrous tissue was reduced, and the conduction velocity of myocardial tissue was increased. Histological analysis showed reduced infarct size, increased left ventricular wall thickness, increased vessel density, and decreased inflammatory response in the infarcted area. Our findings clearly demonstrate that the OGGP3 hydrogel attenuates ventricular remodeling and inhibits infarct dilation, thus showing its potential for the treatment of MI.",Bioactive materials,eng,2023,Feb
Characteristics of an underground stope channel supplied by atmospheric precipitation and its water disaster prevention in the karst mining areas of Guizhou.,"Atmospheric precipitation floods mining areas, which seriously affects the safe production of coal mines. However, research on the mechanism underlying precipitation supplying coal mines, particularly in karst landform areas, remains far from sufficient. Based on the collection of a large amount of geological and hydrogeological mining data and some data related to mine atmospheric precipitation and mine water inflow, the channels of atmospheric precipitation supplying mines in the main coal-producing areas of Guizhou, China, are systematically analysed and studied. They are divided into weathering zone fractures, mining fractures, water diversion faults, water diversion collapse columns and karst channels. Recharge channels have the characteristics of surface infiltration, pipeline flow and layered recharge, as well as self-healing after being filled by surface loess and other materials. The supply of atmospheric precipitation to the coal mine stope is seasonal. The mine water inflow in the rainy season is 1.2 ~ 12 times that in the dry season, with an average of 1.9 times. The supply has hysteresis. The lag time of surface infiltration, pipeline flow and layered flow is 2 ~ 4 days, within 24 h and more than 2 days, respectively. The recharge is affected by the burial depth of the coal seam and the characteristics of the combined upper roof slate. Among the mines affected by atmospheric precipitation and water disasters, some mines have carried out research on the comprehensive treatment of water disasters, implemented supplementary exploration projects such as surface hydrogeological drilling and geophysical exploration, or carried out hydrochemical research. Some mines have adopted water prevention and control projects, such as blocking ground water diversion cracks, constructing water diversion projects, adjusting the mining time of the working face, transforming the drainage system and improving the drainage capacity, to ensure the safe production of mines. This research achievement may provide a theoretical basis and practical experience for the prevention and control of atmospheric precipitation infiltration in coal mines in karst areas.",Scientific reports,eng,2023,Sep
Solid multifunctional granular bioink for constructing chondroid basing on stem cell spheroids and chondrocytes.,"Stem cell spheroids are advanced building blocks to produce chondroid. However, the multi-step operations including spheroids preparation, collection and transfer, the following 3D printing and shaping limit their application in 3D printing. The present study fabricates an 'ALL-IN-ONE' bioink based on granular hydrogel to not only produce adipose derived stem cell (ASC) spheroids, but also realize the further combination of chondrocytes and the subsequent 3D printing. Microgels (6-10<i>μ</i>m) grafted with β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) (MG<sub>β-CD</sub>) were assembled and crosslinked by<i>in-situ</i>polymerized poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAm) to form bulk granular hydrogel. The host-guest action between β-CD of microgels and PNIPAm endows the hydrogel with stable, shear-thinning and self-healing properties. After creating caves, ASCs aggregate spontaneously to form numerous spheroids with diameter of 100-200<i>μ</i>m inside the hydrogel. The thermosensitive porous granular hydrogel exhibits volume change under different temperature, realizing further adsorbing chondrocytes. Then, the granular hydrogel carrying ASC spheroids and chondrocytes is extruded by 3D printer at room temperature to form a tube, which can shrink at cell culture temperature to enhance the resolution. The subsequent ASC spheroids/chondrocytes co-culture forms cartilage-like tissue at 21 d<i>in vitro</i>, which further matures subcutaneously<i>in vivo</i>, indicating the application potential of the fully synthetic granular hydrogel ink toward organoid culture.",Biofabrication,eng,2022,Apr
Molecular Biodynamers: Dynamic Covalent Analogues of Biopolymers.,"Constitutional dynamic chemistry (CDC) features the use of reversible linkages at both molecular and supramolecular levels, including reversible covalent bonds (dynamic covalent chemistry, DCC) and noncovalent interactions (dynamic noncovalent chemistry, DNCC). Due to its inherent reversibility and stimuli-responsiveness, CDC has been widely utilized as a powerful tool for the screening of bioactive compounds, the exploitation of receptors or substrates driven by molecular recognition, and the fabrication of constitutionally dynamic materials. Implementation of CDC in biopolymer science leads to the generation of constitutionally dynamic analogues of biopolymers, biodynamers, at the molecular level (molecular biodynamers) through DCC or at the supramolecular level (supramolecular biodynamers) via DNCC. Therefore, biodynamers are prepared by reversible covalent polymerization or noncovalent polyassociation of biorelevant monomers. In particular, molecular biodynamers, biodynamers of the covalent type whose monomeric units are connected by reversible covalent bonds, are generated by reversible polymerization of bio-based monomers and can be seen as a combination of biopolymers with DCC. Owing to the reversible covalent bonds used in DCC, molecular biodynamers can undergo continuous and spontaneous constitutional modifications via incorporation/decorporation and exchange of biorelevant monomers in response to internal or external stimuli. As a result, they behave as adaptive materials with novel properties, such as self-healing, stimuli-responsiveness, and tunable mechanical and optical character. More specifically, molecular biodynamers combine the biorelevant characters (e.g., biocompatibility, biodegradability, biofunctionality) of bioactive monomers with the dynamic features of reversible covalent bonds (e.g., changeable, tunable, controllable, self-healing, and stimuli-responsive capacities), to realize synergistic properties in one system. In addition, molecular biodynamers are commonly produced in aqueous media under mild or even physiological conditions to suit their biorelated applications. In contrast to static biopolymers emphasizing structural stability and unity by using irreversible covalent bonds, molecular biodynamers are seeking relative structural adaptability and diversity through the formation of reversible covalent bonds. Based on these considerations, molecular biodynamers are capable of reorganizing their monomers, generating, identifying, and amplifying the fittest structures in response to environmental factors. Hence, molecular biodynamers have received considerable research attention over the past decades. Accordingly, the construction of molecular biodynamers through equilibrium polymerization of nucleobase-, carbohydrate- or amino-acid-based monomers can lead to the fabrication of dynamic analogues of nucleic acids (DyNAs), polysaccharides (glycodynamers), or proteins (dynamic proteoids), respectively. In this Account, we summarize recent advances in developing different types of molecular biodynamers as structural or functional biomimetics of biopolymers, including DyNAs, glycodynamers, and dynamic proteoids. We introduce how chemists utilize various reversible reactions to generate molecular biodynamers with specific sequences and well-ordered structures in aqueous medium. We also discuss and list their potential applications in various research fields, such as drug delivery, drug discovery, gene sensing, cancer diagnosis, and treatment.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2017,Feb
Recent advances in eco-friendly fabrics with special wettability for oil/water separation.,"Considering the serious damage to aquatic ecosystems and marine life caused by oil spills and oily wastewater discharge, efficient, environment-friendly and sustainable oil/water separation technology has become an inevitable trend for current development. Herein, fabrics are recognized as eco-friendly materials for water treatment due to their good degradability and low cost. Particularly, fabrics with rough structures and natural hydrophilicity/oleophilicity enable the construction of superwetting surfaces for the selective separation of oil/water mixtures and even complex emulsions. Therefore, superwetting fabrics for efficiently solving oil spills and purifying oily wastewater have received extensive attention. Especially, Janus and smart fabrics are highly anticipated to enable the on-demand and sustainable treatment of oil spills and oily wastewater due to their changeable wettability. Moreover, the fabrication of superwetting fabrics with multifunctional performances for oily wastewater purification can further promote their practical industrial applications, such as photocatalytic, self-cleaning, and self-healing characteristics. However, some potential challenges still exist, which urgently need to be systematically summarized to guide the future development of this research field.

Exploring macrocycles in functional supramolecular gels: from stimuli responsiveness to systems chemistry.,"CONSPECTUS: Supramolecular gels are ideal candidates for soft, stimuli-responsive materials, because they combine the elastic behavior of solids with the microviscous properties of fluids. The dynamic networks of fibers in supramolecular gels are reminiscent of the cytoskeleton of a cell and provide scaffolds to implement function. When gels are made responsive to stimuli, these mechanical properties can be controlled. Gel-sol transitions also open opportunities to immobilize molecules inside the gel's cavities and to release them on demand. To establish selective responsiveness, suitable recognition sites are required influencing the properties of the fiber network depending on the presence of the stimulus. Supramolecular gels are expected to be stimuli-responsive per se, for example, to temperature, mechanical stress, or an environment that is competitive with the noncovalent interactions connecting the low-molecular weight gelators. Nevertheless, the opportunities for controlling the mechanical properties are rather limited, if one merely relies on interfering with these interactions. It would be much more promising to equip the gel with additional receptor sites that offer selectivity for a broader variety of chemical stimuli. Macrocycles often exhibit a distinct host-guest chemistry and thus are excellent candidates for this purpose. A broad variety of macrocycles differing with respect to structure, topology, solubility, or biocompatibility have been incorporated in gels and endow gels with responsiveness and function. Macrocycles can have different roles: They offer rather rigid scaffolds for the construction of structurally well-defined gelator molecules. Furthermore, their host-guest interactions can be integral to gel formation, if these interactions are required to build the gel fibers. Finally, macrocycles can also be functional groups with which gelators are equipped that would also form gels in the absence of the macrocycle. Here, the macrocycle can be used as a binding site to allow additional stimuli control. To combine different stimuli for triggering gel-sol transitions certainly expands the options for establishing stimuli responsiveness. If, for example, an agent trapped inside the gel is only liberated when two different stimuli are present simultaneously, its release can be controlled with much higher precision and selectivity compared with a gel that responds to one stimulus only. In this Account, the recent progress in the construction of functional macrocycle-containing supramolecular gels is summarized. First, recent strategies to engineer responsiveness into macrocycle-containing gels are discussed. Next, different functions are presented including applications as responsive reaction media, for controlled drug-delivery or tissue engineering, and as self-healing materials. Finally, we highlight the recent progress in designing macrocycle-containing supramolecular gel materials exhibiting complex behavior. This field is part of systems chemistry and still in its infancy but appears to be one of the most promising routes to smart responsive materials.",Accounts of chemical research,eng,2014,Jul
A croconate-directed supramolecular self-healable Cd(II)-metallogel with dispersed 2D-nanosheets of hexagonal boron nitride: a comparative outcome of the charge-transport phenomena and non-linear rectifying behaviour of semiconducting diodes.,"The use of croconic acid disodium salt (CADS) as an organic gelator with Cd(II) salt to obtain an efficient soft-scaffold supramolecular self-healable metallogel (Cd-CADS) in <i>N</i>,<i>N</i>-dimethyl formamide (DMF) media was investigated following an ultrasonication technique. The experimentally scrutinized rheological values of the fabricated metallogel not only revealed the visco-elastic property and mechanical stiffness, but also exposed the self-healable behaviour of the gel material. Two-dimensional (2D) nanosheets of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) were incorporated within the gel network to obtain a 2D nanosheet dispersed metallogel of Cd(II) croconate (h-BN@Cd-CADS). The microstructural investigations of the original gel network and hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) 2D nanosheet dispersed gel-network were performed through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and established the interconnecting rod-like fibrous type morphological patterns and inter-connected hexagonal type rod-shaped architecture pattern, respectively. High resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) was used to visualize the morphological distinction of the Cd-CADS metallogel with the h-BN 2D nanosheets. The infrared spectral (FT-IR) outputs helped to identify the formation pathway to construct the semi-solid self-healing flexible metallogel and h-BN 2D nanosheet dispersed metallogel nanocomposite, respectively. Fascinating electronic-charge transportation was revealed in the as-fabricated Cd-CADS and h-BN@Cd-CADS metallogel-based devices. Furthermore, h-BN 2D-nanosheet-directed modulation of the non-linear rectifying feature of the supramolecular Cd-CADS-metallogel was observed, with the h-BN@Cd-CADS metallogel showing a greater rectifying property, implying that it has a higher conductivity compared to the Cd-CADS metallogel.","Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",eng,2022,Jun
Calcium Carbonate Precipitation by Bacillus and Sporosarcina Strains Isolated from Concrete and Analysis of the Bacterial Community of Concrete.,"Microbially induced calcium carbonate precipitation (CCP) is a long-standing but re-emerging environmental engineering process for production of self-healing concrete, bioremediation, and long-term storage of CO2. CCP-capable bacteria, two Bacillus strains (JH3 and JH7) and one Sporosarcina strain (HYO08), were isolated from two samples of concrete and characterized phylogenetically. Calcium carbonate crystals precipitated by the three strains were morphologically distinct according to field emission scanning electron microscopy. Energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry mapping confirmed biomineralization via extracellular calcium carbonate production. The three strains differed in their physiological characteristics: growth at alkali pH and high NaCl concentrations, and urease activity. Sporosarcina sp. HYO08 and Bacillus sp. JH7 were more alkali- and halotolerant, respectively. Analysis of the community from the same concrete samples using barcoded pyrosequencing revealed that the relative abundance of Bacillus and Sporosarcina species was low, which indicated low culturability of other dominant bacteria. This study suggests that calcium carbonate crystals with different properties can be produced by various CCP-capable strains, and other novel isolates await discovery.",Journal of microbiology and biotechnology,eng,2016,Mar
Recombinant Spidroins as the Basis for New Materials.,"Spider web proteins are unique materials created by nature that, considering the combination of their properties, do not have analogues among natural or human-created materials. Obtaining significant amounts of these proteins from natural sources is not feasible. Biotechnological manufacturing in heterological systems is complicated by the very high molecular weight of spidroins and their specific amino acid composition. Obtaining recombinant analogues of spidroins in heterological systems, mainly in bacteria and yeast, has become a compromise solution. Because they can self-assemble, these proteins can form various materials, such as fibers, films, 3D-foams, hydrogels, tubes, and microcapsules. The effectiveness of spidroin hydrogels in deep wound healing, as 3D scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration and as oriented fibers for axon growth and nerve tissue regeneration, was demonstrated in animal models. The possibility to use spidroin micro- and nanoparticles for drug delivery was demonstrated, including the use of modified spidroins for virus-free DNA delivery into animal cell nuclei. In the past few years, significant interest has arisen concerning the use of these materials as biocompatible and biodegradable soft optics to construct photonic crystal super lenses and fiber optics and as soft electronics to use in triboelectric nanogenerators. This review summarizes the latest achievements in the field of spidroin production, the creation of materials based on them, the study of these materials as a scaffold for the growth, proliferation, and differentiation of various types of cells, and the prospects for using these materials for medical applications (e.g., tissue engineering, drug delivery, coating medical devices), soft optics, and electronics. Accumulated data suggest the use of recombinant spidroins in medical practice in the near future.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,eng,2020,Jul
Effects of agarose mould compliance and surface roughness on self-assembled meniscus-shaped constructs.,"The meniscus is a fibrocartilaginous tissue that is critically important to the loading patterns within the knee joint. If the meniscus structure is compromised, there is little chance of healing, due to limited vascularity in the inner portions of the tissue. Several tissue-engineering techniques to mimic the complex geometry of the meniscus have been employed. Of these, a self-assembly, scaffoldless approach employing agarose moulds avoids drawbacks associated with scaffold use, while still allowing the formation of robust tissue. In this experiment two factors were examined, agarose percentage and mould surface roughness, in an effort to consistently obtain constructs with adequate geometric properties. Co-cultures of ACs and MCs (50:50 ratio) were cultured in smooth or rough moulds composed of 1% or 2% agarose for 4 weeks. Morphological results showed that constructs formed in 1% agarose moulds, particularly smooth moulds, were able to maintain their shape over the 4 week culture period. Significant increases were observed for the collagen II:collagen I ratio, total collagen, GAG and tensile and compressive properties in smooth wells. Cell number per construct was higher in the rough wells. Overall, it was observed that the topology of an agarose surface may be able to affect the phenotypic properties of cells that are on that surface, with smooth surfaces supporting a more chondrocytic phenotype. In addition, wells made from 1% agarose were able to prevent construct buckling potentially, due to their higher compliance.",Journal of tissue engineering and regenerative medicine,eng,2009,Oct
Super-Soft DNA/Dopamine-Grafted-Dextran Hydrogel as Dynamic Wire for Electric Circuits Switched by a Microbial Metabolism Process.,"Engineering dynamic systems or materials to respond to biological process is one of the major tasks in synthetic biology and will enable wide promising applications, such as robotics and smart medicine. Herein, a super-soft and dynamic DNA/dopamine-grafted-dextran hydrogel, which shows super-fast volume-responsiveness with high sensitivity upon solvents with different polarities and enables creation of electric circuits in response to microbial metabolism is reported. Synergic permanent and dynamic double networks are integrated in this hydrogel. A serials of dynamic hydrogel-based electric circuits are fabricated: 1) triggered by using water as switch, 2) triggered by using water and petroleum ether as switch pair, 3) a self-healing electric circuit; 4) remarkably, a microbial metabolism process which produces ethanol triggering electric circuit is achieved successfully. It is envisioned that the work provides a new strategy for the construction of dynamic materials, particularly DNA-based biomaterials; and the electric circuits will be highly promising in applications, such as soft robotics and intelligent systems.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",eng,2020,Jul
On-Demand Changeable Theranostic Hydrogels and Visual Imaging-Guided Antibacterial Photodynamic Therapy to Promote Wound Healing.,"Antibacterial wound dressings are confronted with the challenges in real-time imaging of infected wounds and effective removal of bacterial debris after sterilization to promote the healing process. Herein, injectable theranostic hydrogels were constructed from antimicrobial peptide ε-polylysine (ePL) and polydopamine (PDA) nanoparticles for real-time diagnosis of infected wounds, imaging-guided antibacterial photodynamic therapy (PDT), and on-demand removal of bacterial debris. Ureido-pyrimidinone was conjugated on ePL to produce PLU hydrogels through quadruple hydrogen bonding, and the inoculation of tetrakis(4-carboxyphenyl)porphyrin (TCPP)-loaded PDA (PTc) nanoparticles introduced Schiff base linkages in PLU@PTc hydrogels. The double-cross-linked networks enhance mechanical performance, adhesion strength, and self-healing properties of hydrogels, and the dynamic cross-linking enables their photothermal removal. The injection of PLU precursors and PTc NPs generates in situ sol-gel transformation, and the acid-triggered release of TCPP restores fluorescence emissions for real-time imaging of infected wounds under 410 nm illumination. Then, the released TCPP in the infected wounds is illuminated at 660 nm to launch a precise antibacterial PDT, which is strengthened by the bacterial capture on hydrogels. Hydrogels with wrapped bacterial debris are removed under illumination at 808 nm, and the hydrogel dressing change accelerates healing of infected wounds through simultaneous relief of oxidative stress, regulation of inflammatory factors, acceleration of collagen deposition, and promotion of angiogenesis. Thus, this study demonstrates a feasible strategy for wound infection theranostics through bacterial infection-triggered visual imaging, efficient nonantibiotic sterilization, and on-demand dressing change and bacterial debris removal.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Nov
Linking Molecular Behavior to Macroscopic Properties in Ideal Dynamic Covalent Networks.,"Dynamic covalent networks (DCvNs) are increasingly used in advanced materials design with applications ranging from recyclable thermosets to self-healing hydrogels. However, the relationship between the underlying chemistry at the junctions of DCvNs and their macroscopic properties is still not fully understood. In this work, we constructed a robust framework to predict how complex network behavior in DCvNs emerges from the chemical landscape of the dynamic chemistry at the junction. Ideal dynamic covalent boronic ester-based hydrogels were used as model DCvNs. We developed physical models that describe how viscoelastic properties, as measured by shear rheometry, are linked to the molecular behavior of the dynamic junction, quantified via fluorescence and NMR spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Additionally, shear rheometry was combined with Transition State Theory to quantify the kinetics and thermodynamics of network rearrangements, enabling a mechanistic understanding including preferred reaction pathways for dynamic covalent chemistries. We applied this approach to corroborate the ""loose-bolt"" postulate for the reaction mechanism in Wulff-type boronic acids. These findings, grounded in molecular principles, advance our understanding and rational design of dynamic polymer networks, improving our ability to predict, design, and leverage their unique properties for future applications.",Journal of the American Chemical Society,eng,2020,Sep
"Construction of Anti-Ultraviolet ""Shielding Clothes"" on Poly( p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) Fibers: Metal Organic Framework-Mediated Absorption Strategy.","A metal-organic framework (MOF)-mediated adsorption strategy is first developed for improving the anti-ultraviolet (UV) properties of poly( p-phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers. In this work, UIO-66 was successfully anchored onto the surface of PBO fibers by one-step microwave-assisted heating method. The experimental results showed an obviously enhanced surface energy (91.1%), roughness (268.4%), interfacial shear strength (49.0%), and anti-UV properties (66.7%) compared to pristine PBO fibers. The anti-UV dye (tartrazine) was further immobilized onto the surface of PBO fibers via an adsorption strategy mediated by UIO-66. Interestingly, the PBO@tartrazine fibers demonstrated superior anti-UV performance (further up to 81.5%) compared to PBO@UIO-66 fibers. The extraordinary anti-UV properties of PBO@tartrazine fibers could be rationally ascribed to the synergistic effects of UIO-66 and tartrazine molecules. Considering the diversities and functionalities of MOFs and targeted materials, our work indicates that the MOF-mediated adsorption strategy would promisingly endow PBO fibers with other desired performance and applications such as solar-thermal transition and self-healing abilities.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2018,Dec
Multiple Coordination-Derived Bioactive Hydrogel with Proangiogenic Hemostatic Capacity for Wound Repair.,"Bioactive hydrogels with multifunctional properties have shown promising potential in promoting wound repair and skin tissue regeneration. The regulation on different stages of skin wound healing (hemostasis and inflammation) is important for wound repair. Herein, a multiple coordination-derived bioactive hydrogel (SGPA) with anti-inflammatory proangiogenic hemostatic capacity for wound repair is reported. The SGPA is prepared through a facile multiple metal coordination action based on the sodium alginate, metal ions (Gd<sup>3+</sup> ), and bisphosphate functionalized polycitrate. The SGPA exhibits a large porous structure, good injectability, and self-healing performance, as well as controlled biodegradation. Furthermore, the SGPA has good cytocompatibility and hemocompatibility, and can further promote the migration of endothelial cells. The SGPA hydrogel presents good hemostasis capacity in a liver hemorrhage model in vivo. The full-thickness cutaneous wound model demonstrates that the SGPA hydrogel can effectively accelerate the wound repair through down-regulating the inflammatory factors and stimulating the angiogenesis around the wound beds. This work suggests that the multiple metal-organic coordination may be a good strategy to construct the multifunctional bioactive hydrogel for wound repair.",Advanced healthcare materials,eng,2022,Sep
Chitosan for constructing stable polymer-inorganic suspensions and multifunctional membranes for wound healing.,"Restricted by the rigid chain structure, chitosan-based materials are very fragile and easy to break up. Herein, a stable and positively charged chitosan/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> suspension was successfully constructed by adjusting mixing sequence, pH and ratio of chitosan to Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> to prepare a multifunctional membrane (P-CM) with self-standing ability, good flexibility, biocompatibility, excellent photothermal antibacterial properties, and sensitive humidity sensing properties. In the first stage, protonated chitosan acted as sugar coatings was able to be encapsulated on the surface of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> nanosheets by electrostatic self-assembly, in turn achieving charge reversal of the nanoparticles. In the second stage, chitosan acted as molecular needles to suture the membrane formed by chitosan/Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> particles via vacuum filtration (VAF) with the commercial flexible poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) membrane. The as-prepared P-CM membrane simultaneously solves the problem of insufficient flexibility of a single component chitosan membrane and the poor bonding between pure Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>T<sub>x</sub> membranes and substrate membrane.",Carbohydrate polymers,eng,2022,Jun
Scalable and Mechanically Durable Superhydrophobic Coating of SiO<sub>2</sub>/Polydimethylsiloxane/Epoxy Nanocomposite.,"The mechanical durability of superhydrophobic surfaces is of significance for their practical applications. However, few reports about superhydrophobic coating on certain substrates took into consideration both the mechanical stability of the superhydrophobic coating and adhesion stability between the coating and the substrate. Herein, we put forward a facile and efficient strategy to construct robust superhydrophobic coatings by simply spray-coating a composite suspension of SiO<sub>2</sub> nanoparticles, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and epoxy resin (EP) on substrates pretreated with an EP base-coating. The as-obtained coating exhibited excellent superhydrophobicity with water contact angle of 163° and sliding angle of 3.5°, which could endure UV irradiation of 180 h, immersion in acidic or basic solutions for 168 h, and outdoor exposure for over 30 days. Notably, the coating surface retained superhydrophobicity after being successively impacted with faucet water for 1 h, impinged with 360 g sand grains, and abraded with sandpaper of 120 grid under a load of 500 g for 5 m distance. The outstanding mechanical stability was mainly attributed to the cross-linking of EP and the elastic nature of PDMS which ensured strong cohesion inside the whole coating and to the substrate. Additionally, the coating showed self-healing capacity against O<sub>2</sub> plasma etching. The method is simple with the materials commercially available and is expected to be widely applied in outdoor applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,Jan
From intricate to integrated: Biofabrication of articulating joints.,"Articulating joints owe their function to the specialized architecture and the complex interplay between multiple tissues including cartilage, bone and synovium. Especially the cartilage component has limited self-healing capacity and damage often leads to the onset of osteoarthritis, eventually resulting in failure of the joint as an organ. Although in its infancy, biofabrication has emerged as a promising technology to reproduce the intricate organization of the joint, thus enabling the introduction of novel surgical treatments, regenerative therapies, and new sets of tools to enhance our understanding of joint physiology and pathology. Herein, we address the current challenges to recapitulate the complexity of articulating joints and how biofabrication could overcome them. The combination of multiple materials, biological cues and cells in a layer-by-layer fashion, can assist in reproducing both the zonal organization of cartilage and the gradual transition from resilient cartilage toward the subchondral bone in biofabricated osteochondral grafts. In this way, optimal integration of engineered constructs with the natural surrounding tissues can be obtained. Mechanical characteristics, including the smoothness and low friction that are hallmarks of the articular surface, can be tuned with multi-head or hybrid printers by controlling the spatial patterning of printed structures. Moreover, biofabrication can use digital medical images as blueprints for printing patient-specific implants. Finally, the current rapid advances in biofabrication hold significant potential for developing joint-on-a-chip models for personalized medicine and drug testing or even for the creation of implants that may be used to treat larger parts of the articulating joint. © 2017 The Authors.

Realizing an All-Round Hydrogel Electrolyte toward Environmentally Adaptive Dendrite-Free Aqueous Zn-MnO<sub>2</sub> Batteries.,"Flexible energy storage devices are at the forefront of next-generation power supplies, one of the most important components of which is the gel electrolyte. However, shortcomings exist, more or less, for all the currently developed hydrogel electrolytes. Herein, a facile and cost-effective method is developed to construct an all-round hydrogel electrolyte by using cotton as the raw material, tetraethyl orthosilicate as the crosslinker, and glycerol as the antifreezing agent. The obtained hydrogel electrolyte has high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties (e.g., high tensile strength and elasticity), ultralow freezing point, good self-healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat-resistance ability. Remarkably, this hydrogel electrolyte can provide a record-breaking high ionic conductivity of 19.4 mS cm<sup>-1</sup> at -40 °C compared with previously reported aqueous electrolytes for zinc-ion batteries. In addition, this hydrogel electrolyte can significantly inhibit zinc dendritic growth and parasitic side reactions from -40 to 60 °C. With this hydrogel electrolyte, a flexible quasi-solid-state Zn-MnO<sub>2</sub> battery is assembled, which shows remarkable energy densities from -40 to 60 °C. The battery also exhibits outstanding cycling durability and has high endurance under various harsh conditions.

3D Printable Organohydrogel with Long-Lasting Moisture and Extreme-Temperature Tolerance for Flexible Electronics.,"Hydrogels with high electrical conductivity and mechanical stretchability are promising materials for flexible electronics. However, traditional hydrogels are applied in short-term usage at room temperature or low temperature due to their poor water-retention ability and freezing-tolerance property. Here, a dually cross-linked glycerol-organohydrogel (GL-organohydrogel) based on GL and acrylic acid was synthesized in a GL-water binary solvent. Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions working as an electrolyte were added to improve the conductivity of the organohydrogel and form coordination interactions between Fe<sup>3+</sup> ions and carboxyl groups of acrylic acid. The strong hydrogen bonding between GL and water molecules firmly lock water in the organohydrogel network, thereby endowing the GL-organohydrogel with the antifreezing property, long-term stability, and moisture lock-in capability. Our organohydrogel could endure extremely low temperature (-80 °C) over 30 days without freezing and retain its water content (almost 100% of its initial state) after being stored at room temperature (25 °C, 54% humidity) for 30 days. It also demonstrated desired stretchable properties, conductivity, three-dimensional (3D) printability, and self-healing ability. A wearable data glove was constructed by using the GL-organohydrogel and digital light processing technology. This work opens a new avenue for developing hydrogels with long-term stability, moisture lock-in capability, and extreme-temperature tolerance for stretchable electronics.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,Sep
Repair of Avascular Meniscus Tears with Electrospun Collagen Scaffolds Seeded with Human Cells.,"The self-healing capacity of an injured meniscus is limited to the vascularized regions and is especially challenging in the inner avascular regions. As such, we investigated the use of human meniscus cell-seeded electrospun (ES) collagen type I scaffolds to produce meniscal tissue and explored whether these cell-seeded scaffolds can be implanted to repair defects created in meniscal avascular tissue explants. Human meniscal cells (derived from vascular and avascular meniscal tissue) were seeded on ES scaffolds and cultured. Constructs were evaluated for cell viability, gene expression, and mechanical properties. To determine potential for repair of meniscal defects, human meniscus avascular cells were seeded and cultured on aligned ES collagen scaffolds for 4 weeks before implantation. Surgical defects resembling ""longitudinal tears"" were created in the avascular zone of bovine meniscus and implanted with cell-seeded collagen scaffolds and cultured for 3 weeks. Tissue regeneration and integration were evaluated by histology, immunohistochemistry, mechanical testing, and magentic resonance imaging. Ex vivo implantation with cell-seeded collagen scaffolds resulted in neotissue that was significantly better integrated with the native tissue than acellular collagen scaffolds or untreated defects. Human meniscal cell-seeded ES collagen scaffolds may therefore be useful in facilitating meniscal repair of avascular meniscus tears.",Tissue engineering. Part A,eng,2016,Mar
Injectable shear-thinning hydrogels engineered with a self-assembling Dock-and-Lock mechanism.,"Injected therapeutics, such as cells or biological molecules, may have enhanced efficiency when delivered within a scaffold carrier. Here, we describe a dual-component Dock-and-Lock (DnL) self-assembly mechanism that can be used to construct shear-thinning, self-healing, and injectable hydrogels. One component is derived from the RIIα subunit of cAMP-dependent kinase A and is engineered as a telechelic protein with end groups that dimerize (docking step). The second component is derived from the anchoring domain of A-kinase anchoring protein (AD) and is attached to multi-arm crosslinker polymers and binds to the docked proteins (locking step). When mixed, these two DnL components form robust physical hydrogels instantaneously and under physiological conditions. Mechanical properties and erosion rates of DnL gels can be tuned through the AD peptide sequence, the concentration and ratio of each component, and the number of peptides on the cross-linking polymer. DnL gels immediately self-recover after deformation, are resistant to yield at strains as high as 400%, and completely self-heal irrespective of prior mechanical disruption. Mesenchymal stem cells mixed in DnL gels and injected through a fine needle remain highly viable (>90%) during the encapsulation and delivery process, and encapsulated large molecules are released with profiles that correspond to gel erosion. Thus, we have used molecular engineering strategies to develop cytocompatible and injectable hydrogels that have the potential to support cell and drug therapies.",Biomaterials,eng,2012,Mar
"Chinese ink: a programmable, dual-responsive and self-sensing actuator using a healing-assembling method.","Actuators have wide applications in soft robotics and bionic devices. Since the healing ability not only makes actuators have longer service lives, but also allows them to be programmable through welding and assembling, it is regarded as an important feature for state-of-the-art actuators. Nevertheless, it remains a great challenge to integrate multi-functional merits, such as multi-responsiveness, programmable shape-morphing, healing and self-sensing function, simultaneously into a monolithic actuating material. Here, we introduce Chinese ink, a carbon-based material used in traditional calligraphy, to develop programmable, dual-responsive and self-sensing actuators by a healing-assembling method. The ink is combined with graphene oxide (GO) to fabricate a double-layer ink/GO actuator, which shows bi-directional bending under near-infrared light or humidity, owing to the mismatch of the volume change between ink and GO films. The maximal bending curvature is up to 5.2 cm<sup>-1</sup>. Importantly, the entire ink/GO actuator can be healed with the aid of ink solution. Using the healing-assembling method to fabricate advanced structures including a Mobius ring, triangular rings and square rings, diverse actuating modes and complex 3D deformations such as a wavy shape and saddle shape are realized. This method also enables the construction of an artificial mimosa that shows a biomimetic stimulus-responsive behavior. In addition, the ink/GO actuator shows a self-sensing function, which is attributed to the thermoresistivity of the ink film. This research shows the huge potential of Chinese-ink-based actuators for use in smart materials, providing a new idea for the development of new generation multi-functional actuators.",Nanoscale,eng,2021,Dec
Amorphous TiO2 shells: an essential elastic buffer layer for high-performance self-healing eutectic GaSn nano-droplet room-temperature liquid metal battery.,"Gallium-based alloy liquid metal batteries currently face limitations such as volume expansion, unstable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) film and substantial capacity decay. In this study, amorphous titanium dioxide is used to coat eutectic GaSn nanodroplets (eGaSn NDs) to construct the core-shell structure of eGaSn@TiO2 nanodroplets (eGaSn@TiO2 NDs). The amorphous TiO2 shell (~6.5 nm) formed a stable SEI film, alleviated the volume expansion, and provided electron/ion transport channels to achieve excellent cycling performance and high specific capacity. The resulting eGaSn@TiO2 NDs exhibited high capacities of 580, 540, 515, 485, 456 and 426 mAh g-1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 C, respectively. No significant decay was observed after more than 500 cycles with a capacity of 455 mAh g-1 at 1 C. In situ X-ray diffraction (in situ XRD) was used to explore the lithiation mechanism of the eGaSn negative electrode during discharge.

Construction of supramolecular hydrogels using imidazolidinyl urea as hydrogen bonding reinforced factor.,"The development of a new hydrogen bonding reinforced factor is of importance for the design and application of supramolecular hydrogels. Herein, we use a new reinforced factor, imidazolidinyl urea (IU), for the construction of hydrogen bonding supramolecular hydrogels. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), three types of diisocyanates (isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI), 4,4'-methylene bis(cyclohexyl isocyanate) (HMDI) and 4,4'-methylene bis(phenyl isocyanate) (MDI)) and IU were employed to synthesize a series of polymers through hydroxyl-isocyanate chemistry. We found that increased IU content and hydrophobicity of the diisocyanates led to a higher gel-sol transition temperature of the polymer aqueous solutions, and the formed hydrogel showed great self-healing capability in response to external mechanical forces. Moreover, we found that improved diisocyanate hydrophobicity could endow the hydrogel with promising mechanical strength, with 1.6 MPa tensile stress and 460% elongation at the break. The advanced hydrogel can also efficiently dissipate energy during deformation and can quickly recover from 200% strain at room temperature without any assistance. Since IU is commercially available and ready for polymer preparation, our work provides a simple and convenient method for the development of hydrogen bonding supramolecular hydrogels with advanced properties.",Journal of materials chemistry.

Self-Reducible Conjugated Microporous Polyaniline for Long-Term Selective Cr(VI) Detoxication Driven by Tunable Pore Dimension.,"A simple methodology to controllably tune the pore size and Cr(VI) adsorption capacity was reported herein to synthesize a new series of conjugated microporous polyaniline (CMPA) networks. The well-ordered micropore was acquired through our very recent Bristol-Xi'an Jiaotong method, and the pore size was fine-tuned to increase with the increasing length of linkers, mimicking covalent organic frameworks and metal organic frameworks very much. A selective ultrahigh adsorption capacity of 520.8 mg/g was achieved by CMPA-1 in a very fast manner, with a systematically gradual decrease to 173.9 mg/g of CMPA-3 by enlarging the pore size of the networks, featuring tunable adsorption capacity through molecular-size-recognition mechanism. Additionally, our robust CMPA networks, which were constructed by Buchwald-Hartwig chemistry, showed the complete function of polyaniline and were capable of providing, besides large storage capacity for Cr(III), at least 10 reductant/desorption-free cycles for effective Cr(VI) reduction and detoxication through their novel self-reducible redox states. Outcomes showed that our CMPAs could be applied as new self-healing scavengers in the next generation for Cr(VI) storage and detoxication.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Jun
Bonding Mechanical Properties between SMA Fiber and ECC Matrix under Direct Pullout Loads.,"SMAF-ECC material composed of shape memory alloy fiber (SMAF) and engineered cementitious composite (ECC) has good bending and tensile properties, as well as good crack self-healing ability, energy consumption, and self-centering ability. The bond behavior between fiber and matrix is crucial to the effective utilization of the superelasticity of SMAF. The experimental study considered three variables: SMA fiber diameter, fiber end shape, and bond length. The pullout stress-strain curve of SMAF was obtained, and the maximum pullout stress, maximum bond stress, and fiber utilization rate were analyzed. Compared with the straight end and the hook end, the maximum pullout stress of the specimen using the knotted end SMAF is above 900 MPa, the fiber undergoes martensitic transformation, and the fiber utilization rate is above 80%, indicating that the setting of the knotted end can give full play to the superelasticity of the SMAF. Within the effective bond length range, increasing the bond length can increase the maximum anchorage force of the knotted end SMAF. Increasing the fiber diameter can increase the maximum pullout stress and maximum anchoring force of the knotted end SMAF but reduce the utilization rate of SMA fiber. This study provides a reliable theoretical basis for the bonding properties between SMAF and ECC.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2023,Mar
"Engineering the viscoelasticity of gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogels via small ""dynamic bridges"" to regulate BMSC behaviors for osteochondral regeneration.","The dynamic extracellular matrix (ECM) constantly affects the behaviors of cells. To mimic the dynamics of ECM with controllable stiffness and energy dissipation, this study proposes a strategy in which a small molecule, 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde (DB), was used as fast ""dynamic bridges'' to construct viscoelastic gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA)-based hydrogels. The storage modulus and loss modulus of hydrogels were independently adjusted by the covalent crosslinking density and by the number of dynamic bonds. The hydrogels exhibited self-healing property, injectability, excellent adhesion and mechanical properties. Moreover, the <i>in vitro</i> results revealed that the viscous dissipation of hydrogels favored the spreading, proliferation, osteogenesis and chondrogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), but suppressed their adipogenesis. RNA-sequencing and immunofluorescence suggested that the viscous dissipation of hydrogels activated Yes-associated protein (YAP) by stabilizing integrin β1, and further promoted nuclear translocation of smad2/3 and β-catenin to enhance chondrogenesis and osteogenesis. As a result, the viscoelastic GelMA hydrogels with highest loss modulus showed best effect in cartilage and subchondral bone repair. Taken together, findings from this study reveal an effective strategy to fabricate viscoelastic hydrogels for modulating the interactions between cells and dynamic ECM to promote tissue regeneration.",Bioactive materials,eng,2023,Jul
Pro-Regenerative Hydrogel Restores Scarless Skin during Cutaneous Wound Healing.,"The transformation of fibrotic healing process to regenerative one has great potential to fully restore wounded skin. The M2 macrophage phenotype promotes constructive tissue remodeling and instructs tissue repair in a regenerative manner. It is hypothesized that hydrogels that can establish robustness of endogenous cells to regulate M2 phenotype will promote constructive dermal remodeling. Toward this end, a series of dextran-based bioabsorbable hydrogels are developed and self-crosslinkable dextran-isocyanatoethyl methacrylate-ethylamine (DexIEME) is identified as the potential scaffold. The initial screening study revealed that DexIEME has superior biocompatibility in varying concentrations. Although DexIEME brings about low proinflammatory responses, it promotes M2 macrophage phenotype. Then the optimized hydrogel formulation is tested for acute skin injuries using both murine and porcine models. Preliminary data demonstrated that the innovative DexIEME hydrogel promotes complete skin regeneration with hair regrowth on pre-existing scars, while untreated scars remain intact. Preclinical studies further demonstrated that the DexIEME hydrogel regenerated perfect skin during deep porcine wound healing. Overall, the approach to investigate immune-modulated hydrogels yields pro-regenerative DexIEME hydrogel, which may lead to greater clinical success in treating deep dermal injury and attenuating scar formation.",Advanced healthcare materials,eng,2017,Dec

High level of calcium carbonate precipitation achieved by mixed culture containing ureolytic and nonureolytic bacterial strains.,"This study demonstrates a remarkably high level of microbial-induced calcium carbonate precipitation (MICP) using a mixed culture containing TBRC 1396 (Priestia megaterium), TBRC 8147 (Neobacillus drentensis) and ATCC 11859 (Sporosarcina pasteurii) bacterial strains. The mixed culture produced CaCO<sub>3</sub> weights 1·4 times higher than those obtained from S. pasteurii, the gold standard for efficient MICP processes. The three strains were selected after characterization of various Bacillus spp. and related species for their ability to induce the MICP process, especially in an alkaline and high-temperature environment. Results showed that the TBRC 1396 and TBRC 8147 strains, as well as TBRC 5949 (Bacillus subtilis) and TBRC 8986 (Priestia aryabhattai) strains, could generate calcium carbonate at pH 9-12 and temperature 30-40°C, which is suitable for construction and consolidation purposes. The TBRC 8147 strain also exhibited CaCO<sub>3</sub> precipitation at 45°C. The TBRC 8986 and TBRC 8147 strains are nonureolytic bacteria capable of MICP in the absence of urea, which can be used to avoid the generation of undesirable ammonia associated with the ureolytic MICP process. These findings facilitate the successful use of MICP as a sustainable and environmentally friendly technology for the development of various materials, including self-healing concrete and soil consolidation.",Letters in applied microbiology,eng,2022,Oct
Highly conductive and tough polyacrylamide/sodium alginate hydrogel with uniformly distributed polypyrrole nanospheres for wearable strain sensors.,"Conductive hydrogels have attracted widespread attention because of their integrated characteristics of being stretchable, deformable, adhesive, self-healable, and conductive.

SA was employed as a soft template for synthesis of PPy NSs and distribution of PPy NSs uniformly in the hydrogel matrix to construct SA-PPy conductive network. The PAAM-SA-PPy NS hydrogel exhibited both high electrical conductivity (6.44 S/m) and excellent mechanical properties (tensile strength of 560 kPa at 870 %), as along as high toughness, high biocompatibility, good self-healing and adhesion properties. The assembled strain sensors showed high sensitivity and a wide sensing range (a gauge factor of 1.89 for 0-400 % strain and 4.53 for 400-800 % strain, respectively), as well as fast responsiveness and reliable stability. When used as a wearable strain sensor, it was able to monitor a series of physical signals from human large-scale joint motions and subtle muscle movements.

Osteoblast/Osteoclast and Immune Cocktail Therapy of an Exosome/Drug Delivery Multifunctional Hydrogel Accelerates Fracture Repair.,"The osteoblast/osteoclast and M1/M2 macrophage ratios play critical roles in delayed fracture healing. Robust osteoblast differentiation and M2 macrophage polarization can substantiality promote fracture repair; however, the combined effect of these strategies has not been previously studied. In this study, we constructed a cocktail therapy to simultaneously regulate the osteoblast/osteoclast and M1/M2 macrophage balance. The cocktail therapy composed of a natural polymer hyaluronic-acid-based hydrogel (HA hydrogel, which has a tissue-adhesive, injectable, self-healing, anti-inflammation profile), engineered endothelial cell-derived exosomes (EC-Exos<sup>miR-26a-5p</sup>), and APY29, an IRE-1α inhibitor. This allowed for specific delivery of EC-Exos<sup>miR-26a-5p</sup> and APY29 for osteoblast/osteoclast and macrophage regulation, respectively. The results suggested that the cocktail therapy exerted pro-fracture repair effects with each of its components established as indispensable. The assessed cocktail therapy provides insight into synergistic strategies and is useful for developing more suitable pro-fracture repair therapy.",ACS nano,eng,2022,Jan
3D Printed Cartilage-Like Tissue Constructs with Spatially Controlled Mechanical Properties.,"Developing biomimetic cartilaginous tissues that support locomotion while maintaining chondrogenic behavior is a major challenge in the tissue engineering field. Specifically, while locomotive forces demand tissues with strong mechanical properties, chondrogenesis requires a soft microenvironment. To address this challenge, 3D cartilage-like tissue is bioprinted using two biomaterials with different mechanical properties: a hard biomaterial to reflect the macromechanical properties of native cartilage, and a soft biomaterial to create a chondrogenic microenvironment. To this end, a hard biomaterial (MPa order compressive modulus) composed of an interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and alginate hydrogel is developed as an extracellular matrix (ECM) with self-healing properties, but low diffusive capacity. Within this bath supplemented with thrombin, fibrinogen containing human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) spheroids is bioprinted forming fibrin, as the soft biomaterial (kPa order compressive modulus) to simulate cartilage's pericellular matrix and allow a fast diffusion of nutrients. The bioprinted hMSC spheroids improve viability and chondrogenic-like behavior without adversely affecting the macromechanical properties of the tissue. Therefore, the ability to print locally soft and cell stimulating microenvironments inside of a mechanically robust hydrogel is demonstrated, thereby uncoupling the micro- and macromechanical properties of the 3D printed tissues such as cartilage.",Advanced functional materials,eng,2019,Dec
Mechanoactive Nanocomposite Hydrogel to Accelerate Wound Repair in Movable Parts.,"Dynamic full-thickness skin wound healing remains an intricate problem due to the humid environment and frequent exercise. Recently, multifunctional hydrogels have a great promise in wound repair. However, traditional hydrogels only keep the wound moist, protect the wound from bacterial infection, and cannot actively drive dynamic wound closure. Inspired by embryo wound active closure, we constructed a double-sided thermoresponsive mechanoactive (DTM) hydrogel that combines good flexibility, self-healing, wet-tissue adhesion, and antibacterial functions. The strong adhesion of the hydrogel to biological tissues is attributed to ""multiple hydrogen bonding clusters"" without any chemical reaction. The contraction force triggered by temperature is quickly transmitted to dynamic wound edges to resist external mechanical forces and drive wound closure, which can effectively avoid damage to surrounding healthy tissue and reduce the risk of scarring, infection, and inflammation caused by sutures, staples, or clips. Strikingly, in vivo, this hydrogel bandage actively enhanced wound repair in a full-thickness skin defect model by promoting collagen deposition, facilitating angiogenesis, and accelerating wound re-epithelialization. This mechanoactive biological method will provide a facile strategy for joint wound management and demonstrates strong potential in tissue remodeling.",ACS nano,eng,2022,Dec
Recent Progress in Electronic Skin.,"The skin is the largest organ of the human body and can sense pressure, temperature, and other complex environmental stimuli or conditions. The mimicry of human skin's sensory ability via electronics is a topic of innovative research that could find broad applications in robotics, artificial intelligence, and human-machine interfaces, all of which promote the development of electronic skin (e-skin). To imitate tactile sensing via e-skins, flexible and stretchable pressure sensor arrays are constructed based on different transduction mechanisms and structural designs. These arrays can map pressure with high resolution and rapid response beyond that of human perception. Multi-modal force sensing, temperature, and humidity detection, as well as self-healing abilities are also exploited for multi-functional e-skins. Other recent progress in this field includes the integration with high-density flexible circuits for signal processing, the combination with wireless technology for convenient sensing and energy/data transfer, and the development of self-powered e-skins. Future opportunities lie in the fabrication of highly intelligent e-skins that can sense and respond to variations in the external environment. The rapidly increasing innovations in this area will be important to the scientific community and to the future of human life.","Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",eng,2015,Oct
Generation of Self-assembled Vascularized Human Skin Equivalents.,"Human skin equivalents (HSEs) are tissue engineered constructs that model epidermal and dermal components of human skin. These models have been used to study skin development, wound healing, and grafting techniques. Many HSEs continue to lack vasculature and are additionally analyzed through post-culture histological sectioning which limits volumetric assessment of the structure. Presented here is a straightforward protocol utilizing accessible materials to generate vascularized human skin equivalents (VHSE); further described are volumetric imaging and quantification techniques of these constructs. Briefly, VHSEs are constructed in 12 well culture inserts in which dermal and epidermal cells are seeded into rat tail collagen type I gel. The dermal compartment is made up of fibroblast and endothelial cells dispersed throughout collagen gel. The epidermal compartment is made up of keratinocytes (skin epithelial cells) that differentiate at the air-liquid interface. Importantly, these methods are customizable based on needs of the researcher, with results demonstrating VHSE generation with two different fibroblast cell types: human dermal fibroblasts (hDF) and human lung fibroblasts (IMR90s). VHSEs were developed, imaged through confocal microscopy, and volumetrically analyzed using computational software at 4- and 8-week timepoints. An optimized process to fix, stain, image, and clear VHSEs for volumetric examination is described. This comprehensive model, imaging, and analysis techniques are readily customizable to the specific research needs of individual labs with or without prior HSE experience.",Journal of visualized experiments : JoVE,eng,2021,Feb
Recombinant Spider Silk Functionalized Silkworm Silk Matrices as Potential Bioactive Wound Dressings and Skin Grafts.,"Silk is considered to be a potential biomaterial for a wide number of biomedical applications. Silk fibroin (SF) can be retrieved in sufficient quantities from the cocoons produced by silkworms. While it is easy to formulate into scaffolds with favorable mechanical properties, the natural SF does not contain bioactive functions. Spider silk proteins, on the contrary, can be produced in fusion with bioactive protein domains, but the recombinant procedures are expensive, and large-scale production is challenging. We combine the two types of silk to fabricate affordable, functional tissue-engineered constructs for wound-healing applications. Nanofibrous mats and microporous scaffolds made of natural silkworm SF are used as a bulk material that are top-coated with the recombinant spider silk protein (4RepCT) in fusion with a cell-binding motif, antimicrobial peptides, and a growth factor. For this, the inherent silk properties are utilized to form interactions between the two silk types by self-assembly. The intended function, that is, improved cell adhesion, antimicrobial activity, and growth factor stimulation, could be demonstrated for the obtained functionalized silk mats. As a skin prototype, SF scaffolds coated with functionalized silk are cocultured with multiple cell types to demonstrate formation of a bilayered tissue construct with a keratinized epidermal layer under in vitro conditions. The encouraging results support this strategy of fabrication of an affordable bioactive SF-spider silk-based biomaterial for wound dressings and skin substitutes.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2018,Jul
High-Strength and Injectable Supramolecular Hydrogel Self-Assembled by Monomeric Nucleoside for Tooth-Extraction Wound Healing.,"Hydrogels with high mechanical strength and injectability have attracted extensive attention in biomedical and tissue engineering. However, endowing a hydrogel with both properties is challenging because they are generally inversely related. In this work, by constructing a multi-hydrogen-bonding system, a high-strength and injectable supramolecular hydrogel is successfully fabricated. It is constructed by the self-assembly of a monomeric nucleoside molecular gelator (2-amino-2'-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (2-FA)) with distilled water/phosphate buffered saline as solvent. Its storage modulus reaches 1 MPa at a concentration of 5.0 wt%, which is the strongest supramolecular hydrogel comprising an ultralow-molecular-weight (MW < 300) gelator. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent shear-thinning injectability, and completes the sol-gel transition in seconds after injection at 37 °C. The multi-hydrogen-bonding system is essentially based on the synergistic interactions between the double NH<sub>2</sub> groups, water molecules, and 2'-F atoms. Furthermore, the 2-FA hydrogel exhibits excellent biocompatibility and antibacterial activity. When applied to rat molar extraction sockets, compared to natural healing and the commercial hemorrhage agent gelatin sponge, the 2-FA hydrogel exhibits faster degradation and induces less osteoclastic activity and inflammatory infiltration, resulting in more complete bone healing. In summary, this study provides ideas for proposing a multifunctional, high-strength, and injectable supramolecular hydrogel for various biomedical engineering applications.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2022,Apr
Use of Nanocomposites in Bone Regeneration.,"This article examines the compositions of bone tissue grafting and presents tissue culture and engineering formally as an approach for orthopaedic surgery. We assessed articles on bone grafts, analyzed their properties, advantages, and restrictions, and delivered explanations on technologies, including bone-tissue engineering (BTE). Osteo graft materials range from real human bone autografts (self-grafts) to substitute materials that can be used as grafts. These can be used single-handedly or conjointly to improve bone healing and regeneration. Tissue engineering is a relatively newer and evolving alternative for reducing the challenges of bone grafts and improving the rehabilitation of bone fractures and defects. Shortly, the combination of scaffolds, healing factors, gene therapy, and, more recently, 3D printing of tissue-engineered constructs may yield new perceptions. Natural bone tissue has a nanocomposite structure that offers the right biological and physical characteristics. It is essential that the biomaterial resemble real bone tissue in order to regenerate bone tissue. Because they can offer the correct matrix environment, combine desirable biological features, and allow regulated, sequential distribution of numerous growth factors for the different phases of bone tissue regeneration, nanocomposites are the ideal alternative for bone tissue regeneration. This is because no single type of material can replicate the composition, structure, and characteristics of native bone. A relatively new class of materials called nanocomposite biomaterials combines a biopolymeric and biodegradable matrix structure with nanoscale fillers that are bioactive and easily resorbable. There are also some things to think about when using nanoparticles and nanocomposites as scaffolds in clinical settings for bone tissue engineering.",Cureus,eng,2022,Nov

Smart Coating Embedded with pH-Responsive Nanocapsules Containing a Corrosion Inhibiting Agent.,"Triethanolamine (TEA), an amine-based corrosion inhibitor, was encapsulated and then embedded into an epoxy coating to provide long-term corrosion protection of aluminum alloy 3003. TEA was encapsulated by means of free-radical polymerization, yielding an average particle size of 450 nm. An applied epoxy coating containing 10 wt % of the nanocapsules successfully protected an artificially defective area for a long period due to TEA adsorption, which resulted in the formation of an inhibiting layer. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed an inhibition efficiency surpassing 85% when the metal experienced mild corrosion in its early stages, and the inhibiting layer started to form by local pH level change, which triggered the release of TEA. On the basis of the results of a scanning vibrating electrode technique, the current density of the metal surface in the presence of an encapsulated TEA coating was significantly lower than that of the control coating with no nanocapsules. Optical microscope and scanning electron microscope images revealed that the sample surface that had encapsulated TEA nearby was considerably less stained after 60 days of testing compared with that of the control sample, which indicated that the metal substrate was protected by an inhibiting layer. Elemental analysis performed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy further confirmed that the metal surface was well preserved, and a remarkably low oxygen content indicated suppressed metal oxidation. The nuclear magnetic resonance spectra also evidenced a successful release of TEA throughout the experimental period. These findings reflected a spontaneous surface repassivation with the help of encapsulated TEA coating.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2020,Feb
Construction of multifunctional hydrogel based on the tannic acid-metal coating decorated MoS<sub>2</sub> dual nanozyme for bacteria-infected wound healing.,"Bacterial infection, tissue hypoxia and inflammatory response can hinder the infected wound repair process. To mitigate the above issues, tannic acid-chelated Fe-decorated molybdenum disulfide nanosheets (MoS<sub>2</sub>@TA/Fe NSs) with dual enzyme activities were developed and anchored to a multifunctional hydrogel. The hydrogel exhibited excellent antibacterial ability owing to the combined effects of photothermal therapy (PTT), glutathione (GSH) loss, and the peroxidase (POD)-like activity (catalyse H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into ·OH under acid condition) of MoS<sub>2</sub>@TA/Fe NSs. Benefitting from the catalase (CAT)-like activity, the hydrogel could decompose H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into O<sub>2</sub> at neutral pH to relieve hypoxia and supply adequate O<sub>2</sub>. POD-like activity was mainly attributed to MoS<sub>2</sub> NSs, while CAT-like activity was primarily due to TA/Fe complex. Moreover, MoS<sub>2</sub>@TA/Fe NSs endowed the hydrogel with outstanding anti-oxidant ability to scavenge redundant reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) under neutral environment to maintain the balance of antioxidant systems and prevent inflammation. In addition, the hydrogel could inhibit the release of inflammatory factors for the anti-inflammatory property of TA. TA retained partial phenolic hydroxyl groups, which cross-linked the nanosheets to the network structure of the hydrogel and promoted the adhesion of hydrogels. Due to the dynamic boron ester bonds between polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), dextran (Dex), MoS<sub>2</sub>@TA/Fe, and borax, the hydrogel demonstrated fast self-healing and rapid shape adaptability. This shape-adaptable adhesive hydrogel could fill the whole wound and closely contact the wound, ensuring that it achieved its functions with maximum efficiency. The MoS<sub>2</sub>@TA/Fe nanozyme-anchored multifunctional hydrogel showed high potential for bacteria-infected wound healing.",Bioactive materials,eng,2022,Mar

"Self-Healing, Thermadapt Triple-Shape Memory Ionomer Vitrimer for Shape Memory Triboelectric Nanogenerator.","Benefiting from the associative exchange reaction, vitrimers could be deformed to various shapes while maintaining the integrity of the network, thus being regarded as promising candidates for shape memory polymers. However, it is still a challenge to design the highly desired smart electronic devices with triple and multishape memory performances through a facile method. Here, a novel dual-cross-linked poly(acrylonitrile-<i>co</i>-butyl acrylate-<i>co</i>-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-<i>co</i>-zinc methacrylate) (Zn-PABHM) copolymer was developed via a facile and one-pot free radical polymerization strategy. Ionic cross-linking, the transcarbamoylation reaction, and glass transition were used to fix the permanent shape and two temporary shapes of the obtained ionomer vitrimer, respectively. The thermomechanical and stress relaxation performances of Zn-PABHM vitrimer can be customized by tuning the proportion of the chemical cross-linking and physical cross-linking knots. Furthermore, the Zn-PABHM was employed to construct a shape memory triboelectric nanogenerator, which demonstrates distinctive performance and tunable electrical outputs (37.4-96.0 V) due to variable contact areas enabled by triple shape memory effects. Consequently, the triple-shape memory ionomer vitrimer obtained via a facile and one-pot synthetic strategy has great potential in smart multifunctional electronic devices.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Oct
A novel granular sludge-based and highly corrosion-resistant bio-concrete in sewers.,"Bio-concrete is known for its self-healing capacity although the corrosion resistance was not investigated previously. This study presents an innovative bio-concrete by mixing anaerobic granular sludge into concrete to mitigate sewer corrosion. The control concrete and bio-concrete (with granular sludge at 1% and 2% of the cement weight) were partially submerged in a corrosion chamber for 6 months, simulating the tidal-region corrosion in sewers. The corrosion rates of 1% and 2% bio-concrete were about 17.2% and 42.8% less than that of the control concrete, together with 14.6% and 35.0% less sulfide uptake rates, 15.3% and 55.6% less sulfate concentrations, and higher surface pH (up to 1.8 units). Gypsum and ettringite were major corrosion products but in smaller sizes on bio-concrete than that of control concrete. The total relative abundance of corrosion-causing microorganisms, i.e. sulfide-oxidizing bacteria, was significantly reduced on bio-concrete, while more sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was detected. The corrosion-resistance of bio-concrete was mainly attributed to activities of SRB derived from the granular sludge, which supported the sulfur cycle between the aerobic and anaerobic corrosion sub-layers. This significantly reduced the net production of biogenic sulfuric acid and thus corrosion. The results suggested that the novel granular sludge-based bio-concrete provides a highly potential solution to reduce sewer corrosion.",The Science of the total environment,eng,2021,Oct
Azacyclic Anchor-Enabled Cohesive Graphite Electrodes for Sustainable Anion Storage.,"Advanced energy storage devices are indispensable for expanding electric mobility applications. While anion intercalation-type redox chemistry in graphite cathodes has opened the path to high-energy-density batteries, surpassing the limited energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), a significant challenge remains: the large volume expansion of graphite upon anion intercalation. In this study, we present a novel polymeric binder and cohesive graphite cathode design for dual-ion batteries (DIBs), which exhibit remarkable stability even under high voltage conditions (>5 V). The innovative binder incorporates an acrylate moiety ensuring superior oxidative stability and self-healing features, along with an azide moiety, which allows for azacyclic covalent bonding with graphite and interchain crosslinking. A simple one-hour ultraviolet (UV) treatment is sufficient for binder fixation within the electrode, leading to the covalent bond formation with graphite and the creation of a robust three-dimensional network. This modification facilitates deeper and more reversible anion intercalation, leading to improved capacity, extended lifespan, and sustainable anion storage. Our binder design, exhibiting exceptional adhesive properties and effective stress mitigation, enables the construction of ultrathick graphite cathodes. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of advanced binders, paving the way for high-performance DIBs. This article is protected by copyright.

Three-Dimensional Binary-Conductive-Network Silver Nanowires@Thiolated Graphene Foam-Based Room-Temperature Self-Healable Strain Sensor for Human Motion Detection.,"A lot of attention has recently been focused on wearable strain sensors because of their promising applications in the rising areas of human motion detection, health monitoring, and smart human-machine interaction. However, the design and fabrication of self-healable strain sensors with superior overall properties including stretchability, sensitivity, response ability, stability, and durability is still a huge challenge. Herein, we report an innovative self-healable strain sensor with exceptional overall performance constructed with three-dimensional binary-conductive-network silver nanowire-coated thiolated graphene foam (AgNWs@TGF) and room-temperature self-healing functionalized polyurethane (FPU) elastomer. Taking advantage of the good ductility and continuity of the AgNWs@TGF binary structure and the excellent resilience of the FPU, the strain sensor exhibits good stretchability (up to 60% strain), high sensitivity [gauge factor (GF) of 11.8 at 60% strain and detection limit of 0.1% strain], fast response ability (response/recovery time of 40/84 ms), and exceptional durability for 800 cycles of fatigue test. Besides, the highly flexible polydimethylsiloxane chains, strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and dynamic exchange reaction of aromatic disulfides ensure the sensor excellent recovery property of electrical conductivity, and the GF of sensor after self-healed only increases slightly. More importantly, the sensor is successfully applied for detecting a variety of human motions including pulse beats, voice recognitions, various joint movements, and handwriting. The method for preparing room-temperature self-healable strain sensor is facile, scalable, and cost-effective.

Self-Supporting Hyaluronic Acid-Functionalized G-Quadruplex-Based Perfusable Multicomponent Hydrogels Embedded in Photo-Cross-Linkable Matrices for Bioapplications.,"Dynamic G-quadruplex supramolecular hydrogels have aroused great interest in a broad range of bioapplications. However, neither the development of native extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived natural biopolymer-functionalized G-quadruplex hydrogels nor their use to create perfusable self-supporting hydrogels has been explored to date, despite their intrinsic potential as carrier vehicles of therapeutic agents, or even living cells in advanced regenerative therapies, or as platforms to enable the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen to sustain long-term cell survival. Herein, we developed a dynamic co-assembling multicomponent system that integrates guanosine (G), 3-aminophenylboronic acid functionalized hyaluronic acid (HA-PBA), and potassium chloride to bioengineer strong, homogeneous, and transparent HA-functionalized G-quadruplex hydrogels with injectable, thermo-reversible, conductive, and self-healing properties. The supramolecular polymeric hydrogels were developed by hydrogen bonding and <i>π-π</i> stacking interactions between G coupled <i>via</i> dynamic covalent boronate ester bonds to HA-PBA and stabilized by K<sup>+</sup> ions, as demonstrated by a combination of experiments and molecular dynamics simulations. The intrinsic instability of the self-assembled G-quadruplex structures was used to bioengineer self-supporting perfusable multicomponent hydrogels with interconnected size and shape-tunable hollow microchannels when embedded in 3D methacrylated gelatin supporting matrices. The microchannel-embedded 3D constructs have shown enhanced cell viability when compared to the bulk hydrogels, holding great promise for being use as artificial vessels for enabling the diffusion of nutrients and oxygen essential for cell survival. The proposed approach opens new avenues on the use of ECM-derived natural biopolymer-functionalized dynamic G-quadruplex hydrogels to design next-generation smart systems for being used in tissue regeneration, drug screening, or organ-on-a-chip.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2023,Jul
Analyzing the Mechanism of Functional Groups in Phosphate Additives on the Interface of LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.15</sub>Al<sub>0.05</sub>O<sub>2</sub> Cathode Materials.,"The design of a functional electrolyte system that is compatible with the LiNi<sub>0.8</sub>Co<sub>0.15</sub>Al<sub>0.05</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (LNCA) cathode is of great importance for advanced lithium-ion batteries (LIBs). In this work, chelated lithium salts of lithium difluoro(bisoxalato) phosphate (LiDFBOP) and lithium tetrafluoro(oxalate) phosphate (LTFOP) are synthesized by a facile and general method. Then, the complexes of LiDFBOP, LTFOP, and lithium difluorophosphate (LiDFP), all of which have a central phosphorus atom, were selected as the salt-type additives for the LiPF<sub>6</sub>-based electrolyte to improve the electrochemical performances of LNCA/Li half-batteries, respectively. The results of electrochemical tests, quantum chemistry calculations, potential-resolved <i>in situ</i> electrochemical impedance (PRIs-EIS) measurements, and surface analyses show that the interface property and the battery performance are closely associated with molecular structures of phosphorus-centered complex additives. It indicates that LiDFP with the P═O bond can significantly reduce the interfacial impedance of LNCA/Li half-batteries due to the increase of Li<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> and the decrease of Li<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in the cathode electrolyte interface (CEI). While in LiDFBOP, according to the calculated vertical ionization potential (VIP), the two oxalate-chelated ligands bring about a bidirectional cross-linking reaction, which makes it preferential to be oxidized. This process is self-healing and can form a dense and stretched CEI, which is favorable to the cycle performance at the late stage. In contrast, the polymerization reaction will occur in one direction for LTFOP due to its lone oxalate ligand. Additionally, an unfavorable side reaction between LTFOP and EC has been proposed by the aid of Gibbs free energy calculation. This is a good explanation for the formation of the uneven and unstable CEI, as well as the continuous decomposition of the electrolyte in PRIs-EIS measurement. This work has an extensive applicability and practical significance not only for molecular designing of novel lithium salts, but also for the construction of a functional electrolyte system that is compatible with different electrode materials.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Apr
Direct and Efficient Incorporation of DOPA into Resilin-Like Proteins Enables Cross-Linking into Tunable Hydrogels.,"3,4-Dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), a naturally occurring yet noncanonical amino acid, endows protein polymers with diverse chemical reactivities and novel functionalities. Although many efforts have been made to incorporate DOPA into proteins, the incorporation efficiency and production titer remain low and severely hinder the exploration of these peculiar proteins for biomaterial fabrication. Here, we report an efficient biosynthetic strategy to produce large amounts of DOPA-incorporated structural proteins for the fabrication of hydrogels with tunable mechanical properties. First, synthetic genes were constructed that encode repetitive resilin-like proteins (RLPs) with varying proportions of tyrosine residues and molecular weights (<i>M</i><sub>w</sub>). Decoding of these genes into RLPs incorporated with DOPA was achieved via mis-aminoacylation of DOPA by endogenous tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS) in recombinant <i>Escherichia coli</i> cells. By developing a stoichiometry-guided two-phase culture strategy, we achieved independent control of the bacterial growth and protein synthesis phases. This enabled hyperproduction of the DOPA-incorporated RLPs at gram-per-liter levels and with a high DOPA incorporation yield of 76-85%. The purified DOPA-containing RLPs were then successfully cross-linked into bulk hydrogels via facile DOPA-Fe<sup>3+</sup> complexations. Interestingly, these hydrogels exhibited viscoelastic and self-healing properties that are highly dependent on the catechol content and <i>M</i><sub>w</sub> of the RLPs. Finally, exploration of the molecular cross-linking mechanisms revealed that higher DOPA contents of the proteins would result in the concomitant occurrence of metal coordination and oxidative covalent cross-linking. In summary, our results suggest a useful platform to generate DOPA-functionalized protein materials and provide deeper insights into the gelation systems based on DOPA chemistry.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2023,Apr
Aggregation-Induced Emission Boosting the Study of Polymer Science.,"The past one hundred years have witnessed the great development of polymer science. The advancement of polymer science is closely related with the development of characterization techniques and methods, from viscometry in molecular weight determination to advanced techniques including differential scanning calorimetry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and scanning electron microscopy. However, these techniques are normally constrained to tedious sample preparation, high costs, harsh experimental conditions, or ex situ characterization. Fluorescence technology has the merits of high sensitivity and direct visualization. Contrary to conventional aggregation-causing quenching fluorophores, those dyes with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics show high emission efficiency in aggregate states. Based on the restriction of intramolecular motions for AIE properties, the AIE materials are very sensitive to the surrounding microenvironments owing to the twisted propeller-like structures and therefore offer great potential in the study of polymers. The AIE concept has been successfully used in polymer science and provides a deeper understanding on polymer structure and properties. In this review, the applications of AIEgens in polymer science for visualizing polymerization, glass transition, dissolution, crystallization, gelation, self-assembly, phase separation, cracking, and self-healing are exemplified and summarized. Lastly, the challenges and perspectives in the study of polymer science using AIEgens are addressed.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2022,Aug
Quaternized chitin/tannic acid bilayers layer-by-layer deposited poly(lactic acid)/polyurethane nanofibrous mats decorated with photoresponsive complex and silver nanoparticles for antibacterial activity.,"Chronic wounding treatment based on bacterially infected diabetes suffers an essential limitation in persistent skin injuries due to the resistance of progressive antibiotics, which inhibits the process of healing with wound tissue. Therefore, biologically friendly and nontoxic bio-based mats without antibiotics are taken for granted as a versatile platform for biomedical dressing, but urgently necessitates further functional diversification. Herein, a novel tannic acid (TA)/silver (Ag)-modified poly(lactic acid) (PLA)/Polyurethane (PU) antibacterial hybrid nanofibers were successfully constructed by electrospinning technology. Layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly technique was utilized to produce membranes via deposited biocompatible quaternized chitin (QC) and TA. The mats are enabled with outstanding flexibility, antibacterial activity, great hemocompatibility, and good ROS-scavenger in a wounding environment. Consequently, the basis of morphology and structure of electrospun membranes was verified by SEM and FT-IR. Besides, the LBL-structured surface was proved to impart improved wettability and hydrophilic via the test of water contact angle. Additionally, antimicrobial experiments demonstrate the effective broad-spectrum antibacterial ability of as-prepared hybrids, inhibiting infection of gram-positive microbial (S. aureus) as well as gram-negative microbial. Finally, the anti-oxidation performance holds great promise in conducive to the formation favorable physiological environment for wound healing.

Effect of Montmorillonite Nanogel Composite Fillers on the Protection Performance of Epoxy Coatings on Steel Pipelines.,"Montmorillonite (MMT) clay mineral is widely used as filler for several organic coatings. Its activity is increased by exfoliation via chemical modification to produce nanomaterials. In the present work, the modification of MMT to form nanogel composites is proposed to increase the dispersion of MMT into epoxy matrices used to fill cracks and holes produced by the curing exotherms of epoxy resins. The dispersion of MMT in epoxy improved both the mechanical and anti-corrosion performance of epoxy coatings in aggressive marine environments. In this respect, the MMT surfaces were chemically modified with different types of 2-acrylamido-2-methyl propane sulfonic acid (AMPS) nanogels using a surfactant-free dispersion polymerization technique. The effect of the chemical structure, nanogel content and the interaction with MMT surfaces on the surface morphology, surface charges and dispersion in the epoxy matrix were investigated for use as nano-filler for epoxy coatings. The modified MMT nanogel epoxy composites showed excellent resistance to mechanical damage and salt spray resistance up to 1000 h. The interaction of MMT nanogel composites with the epoxy matrix and good response of AMPS nanogel to sea water improve their ability to act as self-healing materials for epoxy coatings for steel.","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2017,Jun
Osteogenesis promotion by injectable methacryloylated gelatin containing psoralen and its bacteriostatic properties.,"The treatment of periodontitis focuses on controlling the progression of inflammation, reducing plaque accumulation, and promoting bone tissue reconstruction. Among them, the reconstruction of irregular bone resorption caused by periodontitis is a long-standing challenge. At present, the local drug treatment of periodontitis is mainly anti-inflammatory and antibacterial drugs. In this study, psoralen (Pso), a Chinese herbal medicine with anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, and osteogenic effects, was selected for the local treatment of periodontitis. Meanwhile, an injectable methacrylate gelatin (GelMA) platform loading with Pso was constructed. Pso-GelMA had the properties of fluidity, light cohesion, self-healing, and slow release, which could be better used in the deep and narrow structure of the periodontal pocket, and greatly increased the effectiveness of local drug delivery. The pore size of Gelma hydrogel did not change after loading Pso by SEM. In vitro, Pso-GelMA effectively upregulated the expression of osteogenic genes and proteins, increased alkaline phosphatase activity, promoted the mineralisation of rat bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) extracellular matrix, and had significant antibacterial effects on Staphylococcus aureus and Fusobacterium nucleatum. Therefore, Pso-GelMA has immense promise in the adjuvant treatment of periodontitis.",IET nanobiotechnology,eng,2023,Jun
Grafting of maleic anhydride on poly(lactic acid)/hydroxyapatite composites augments their ability to support osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells.,"Implantation of bone substitutes is the treatment of choice for bone defects exceeding a critical size, when self-healing becomes impossible. The use of 3D printing techniques allows the construction of scaffolds with customized properties. However, there is a lack of suitable materials for bone replacement. In this study, maleic anhydride-grafted poly (lactic acid) (MAPLA) was investigated as a potential compatibilizer agent for 3D-printed polylactic acid (PLA)/hydroxyapatite (HA) composites, in order to enhance the physicochemical and biological properties of the scaffolds. The grafting process was performed by reactive processing in a torque rheometer, with the evaluation of the use of different concentrations of maleic anhydride (MA). The success of the grafting reaction was confirmed by titration of acid groups and spectroscopic analyses, indicating the presence of succinic anhydride groups on the PLA chain. Morphological analysis of the PLA/HA 3D scaffolds, using SEM, revealed that the use of the compatibilizer resulted in a structure free from voids and holes. The compatibilization also increased the degradation process. On the other hand, TGA and DSC analyses revealed that the use of a compatibilizer had little effect on the thermal properties of the composite. Most importantly, the samples with compatibilizer were demonstrated to have a minimal cytotoxic effect on human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), promoting the osteogenic differentiation of these cells in a medium without the addition of classical osteogenic factors. Therefore, the grafting of PLA/HA composites improved their physicochemical and biological properties, especially the induction of MSC osteogenic differentiation, demonstrating the potential of these scaffolds for bone tissue replacement.",Journal of biomaterials applications,eng,2023,Feb
In Situ Buildup of Zinc Anode Protection Films with Natural Protein Additives for High-Performance Zinc Battery Cycling.,"The uncontrolled growth of dendrites and serious side reactions, such as hydrogen evolution and corrosion, significantly hinder the industrial application and development of aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs). This article presents ovalbumin (OVA) as a multifunctional electrolyte additive for aqueous ZIBs. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the OVA additive can replace the solvated sheath of recombinant hydrated Zn<sup>2+</sup> through the coordination water, preferentially adsorb on the surface of the Zn anode, and construct a high-quality self-healing protective film. Notably, the OVA-based protective film with strong Zn<sup>2+</sup> affinity will promote uniform Zn deposition and inhibit side reactions. As a result, Zn||Zn symmetrical batteries in ZnSO<sub>4</sub> electrolytes containing OVA achieve a cycle life exceeding 2200 h. Zn||Cu batteries and Zn||MnO<sub>2</sub> (2 A g<sup>-1</sup>) full batteries show excellent cycling stability for 2500 cycles, demonstrating promising application prospects. This study provides insights into utilizing natural protein molecules to modulate the kinetics of Zn<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and enhance the stability of the anode interface.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,Jul
Fiber Optic-Based Durability Monitoring in Smart Concrete: A State-of-Art Review.,"Concrete is the most commonly used construction material nowadays. With emerging cutting-edge technologies such as nanomaterials (graphene, carbon nanotubes, etc.), advanced sensing (fiber optics, computer tomography, etc.), and artificial intelligence, concrete can now achieve self-sensing, self-healing, and ultrahigh performance. The concept and functions of smart concrete have thus been partially realized. However, due to the wider application location (coastal areas, cold regions, offshore, and deep ocean scenarios) and changing climate (temperature increase, more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, higher moisture, etc.), durability monitoring (pH, ion penetration, carbonation, corrosion, etc.) becomes an essential component for smart concrete. Fiber optic sensors (FOS) have been widely explored in recent years for concrete durability monitoring due to their advantages of high sensitivity, immunity to harsh environments, small size, and superior sensitivity. The purpose of this review is to summarize FOS development and its application in concrete durability monitoring in recent years. The objectives of this study are to (1) introduce the working principle of FOS, including fiber Bragg grating (FBG), long-period fiber grating (LPFG), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), fluorescence-based sensors, and distributed fiber optic sensors (DFOS); (2) compare the sensitivity, resolution, and application scenarios of each sensor; and (3) discuss the advantages and disadvantages of FOS in concrete durability monitoring. This review is expected to promote technical development and provide potential research paths in the future for FOS in durability monitoring in smart concrete.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2023,Sep
Improvements on biological and antimicrobial properties of titanium modified by AgNPs-loaded chitosan-heparin polyelectrolyte multilayers.,"Microbial infection around dental implants is a major cause for the loss of devices, including soft tissue infection in early period, post-operation peri-implantitis, and osseointegration failure. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with wide antimicrobial spectrum, strong antimicrobial effect and hypotoxicity, as well as low incidence of antibiotic resistance, are widely involved in biomedical applications. Herein, firmly anchoring AgNPs onto the surface of implants through physical-chemical reaction is likely to relieve the above issues. In this study, AgNPs were biosynthesized by a simple and ""green"" method with chitosan (CS) as stabilizing and reducing agents. Then, AgNPs-loaded CS-heparin polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) were constructed on alkali-heat treated titanium (Ti) substrates via layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly technique. The successful surface modification could be confirmed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and the constructed system could provide the continuous release of Ag<sup>+</sup> over 28 days till mucosa healing. In short, this work revealed that the construction of multilayer coatings containing AgNPs on Ti substrates promoted adhesion and proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and also enhanced the antimicrobial properties. This manifests the LbL technique is a viable and promising method for forming continuous antimicrobial coatings, to reduce microbial infection and improve the quality of peri-implant soft tissue seal.

A hybrid hydrogel constructed using drug loaded mesoporous silica and multiple response copolymer as an intelligent dressing for wound healing of diabetic foot ulcers.,"Traditional wound dressings have poor mechanical properties and a single function, which cannot achieve rapid healing of diabetic wounds in a unique physiological microenvironment. In order to develop multifunctional hydrogel dressings with appropriate biological activity to accelerate wound healing and obtain better clinical therapeutic effects, herein we report a hybrid system based on drug loaded mesoporous silica and injectable polymer hydrogels mixed with hypoglycemic drug metformin (Met) as a dressing for diabetic wounds. Firstly, a copolymer with the phenylboronic acid group in the side group, poly(acrylamide-<i>co</i>-dimethylaminopropylacrylamide-<i>co</i>-methacrylamidophenylboronic acid) (abbreviated as PB), was prepared. PB was mixed with polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to obtain an injectable hydrogel (named PP) with pH/glucose dual responsiveness, which was formed through the combination of the phenylborate group of PB and <i>o</i>-diol of PVA. In another reaction, polydopamine-modified mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN@PDA) were prepared and used to adsorb antibiotic tetracycline hydrochloride (TH) to obtain drug-loaded MSN@PDA-TH nanoparticles. Subsequently, the hybrid hydrogel dressing (abbreviated as PP/MSN@PDA-TH/Met) was obtained by mixing PB, PVA, Met and MSN@PDA-TH. The self-healing, rheological and adhesive properties of the hybrid hydrogel were characterized. The results show that the hydrogel dressing has good physical properties. Met and TH were released <i>in vitro</i> in different pH media and glucose environments. The results show that the hydrogel dressing has dual responsiveness towards pH and glucose, and can continuously release metformin and tetracycline, which is conducive to accelerating wound healing. The antimicrobial activity, ROS clearance ability and biocompatibility of the hydrogel dressing were evaluated. The results indicate that the hydrogel dressing was multifunctional. Finally, a full-thickness wound repair model of diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin (STZ) was established. The hybrid hydrogel dressing was applied to the wound surface of mice. The wound healing testing on diabetic mice confirmed that the wound covered with the hybrid hydrogel dressing was completely healed with the formation of the new skin and hair within 9 days to 12 days. Histological analysis indicates that, compared to the PBS control, the hydrogel dressing did not cause significant inflammation in the wound, and a large number of blood vessels, glands and hair follicles appeared. This study provides a good strategy for multi-drug synergistic treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.",Journal of materials chemistry. B,eng,2023,Jun
"Bioinspired Stabilization of Amorphous Calcium Carbonate by Carboxylated Nanocellulose Enables Mechanically Robust, Healable, and Sensing Biocomposites.","Nature builds numerous structurally complex composites with fascinating mechanical robustness and functionalities by harnessing biopolymers and amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC). The key to successfully mimicking these natural designs is efficiently stabilizing ACC, but developing highly efficient, biodegradable, biocompatible, and sustainable stabilizing agents remains a grand challenge since anhydrous ACC is inherently unstable toward crystallization in the wet state. Inspired by the stabilized ACC in crustacean cuticles, we report the efficient stabilization ability of the most abundant biopolymer-cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) for ACC. Through the cooperative stabilizing effect of surface carboxyl groups and a rigid segregated network, the CNFs exhibit long-term stability (more than one month) and achieved a stabilization efficiency of 3.6 and 4.4 times that of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and alginate, respectively, even higher than poly(acrylic acid). The resulting CNF/ACC dispersions can be constructed into transparent composite films with the high strength of 286 MPa and toughness up to 28.5 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>, which surpass those of the so far reported synthetic biopolymer-calcium carbonate/phosphate composites. The dynamic interfacial interaction between nanocomponents also provides the composite films with good self-healing properties. Owing to their good wet stability, the composite films present high humidity sensitivity for monitoring respiration and finger contact.",ACS nano,eng,2023,Apr
Mucosal colonic tube fistula with antireflux wrap for antegrade colonic enema.,"Antegrade enemas can provide children with excellent faecal continence in situations where adequate control has been compromised because of underlying congential anomaly or poor surgical outcome in their treatment. The enema is often delivered through an appendicostomy. If the appendix is absent or utilized for another purpose, then placement of a chait tube or caecostomy button can provide access to the colon for the enema. However, these devices may be associated with breakages, accidental removal and leakage and replacement may require another operative procedure under a general anaesthetic. Full thickness colonic tubes can also be constructed at any point along the colon but in the author's experience, they can be associated with significant leakage of both gas and faecal material. The construction of a mucosal colonic tube with anti-reflux wrap is a technique that avoids the above problems and offers a distinctive advantage in selected situations. The technique relies on tabularising mucosa alone to create a continent fistula. Six children with severe soiling underwent the technique. The outcomes were evaluated using a modified quality of life score (QOLI). The score included assessment of soiling, staining, odour, self-esteem and socialization measure. Technical evaluation included analysis of the ease of catheterization and continence of the mucosal fistula site. All six patients had dramatic improvement in their faecal continence with complete resolution of soiling in all six. Follow up median is 42 months and the range is 6-48 months. QOLI scores improved from a total of 4.75 to 18.5. Possible range is 0-21. All the six fistula sites catheterize easily and no stenosis or faecal leakage has occurred. Two patients required treatment of minor granulations at the entry site of the fistula during the early healing phase.",Pediatric surgery international,eng,2009,Jun
Acrylate-functionalized porphyrin-covalent organic framework for bacterial-targeted and reaction-enhanced synergistic phototherapy/chemotherapy toward sterilization and wound healing.,"Porphyrinic covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as prospective materials in photodynamic and photothermal sterilization. However, it is still a great challenge to construct an efficient COF-based sterilizing agent with good photothermal and photodynamic properties and bacterial targeting ability. Herein, we report a multifunctional porphyrin-COF for bacterial-targeted and reaction-enhanced synergistic phototherapy/chemotherapy for sterilization and wound healing. The ordered crystal structure of the porphyrin-COF not only effectively avoids the self-aggregation-induced quenching of the porphyrin monomer, but also facilitates the storage and transport of singlet oxygen. The acrylate substituent in the other monomer serves as a bacterial targeting moiety and the <i>in situ</i> reaction site with the sulfhydryl group of the bacterial surface protein <i>via</i> a Michael addition reaction, thus fixing the bacteria on the surface of COF and making them lose the colonization ability. Furthermore, the bonding of COF and bacteria further amplifies the therapeutic efficiency of phototherapy. Therefore, the developed multifunctional sterilization platform not only provides a new strategy for the design of novel bactericidal materials but also broadens the biological applications of COF-based materials.",Biomaterials science,eng,2023,Feb

3D PCL/Gelatin/Genipin Nanofiber Sponge as Scaffold for Regenerative Medicine.,"Recent advancements in tissue engineering and material science have radically improved in vitro culturing platforms to more accurately replicate human tissue. However, the transition to clinical relevance has been slow in part due to the lack of biologically compatible/relevant materials. In the present study, we marry the commonly used two-dimensional (2D) technique of electrospinning and a self-assembly process to construct easily reproducible, highly porous, three-dimensional (3D) nanofiber scaffolds for various tissue engineering applications. Specimens from biologically relevant polymers polycaprolactone (PCL) and gelatin were chemically cross-linked using the naturally occurring cross-linker genipin. Potential cytotoxic effects of the scaffolds were analyzed by culturing human dermal fibroblasts (HDF) up to 23 days. The 3D PCL/gelatin/genipin scaffolds produced here resemble the complex nanofibrous architecture found in naturally occurring extracellular matrix (ECM) and exhibit physiologically relevant mechanical properties as well as excellent cell cytocompatibility. Samples cross-linked with 0.5% genipin demonstrated the highest metabolic activity and proliferation rates for HDF. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images indicated excellent cell adhesion and the characteristic morphological features of fibroblasts in all tested samples. The three-dimensional (3D) PCL/gelatin/genipin scaffolds produced here show great potential for various 3D tissue-engineering applications such as ex vivo cell culturing platforms, wound healing, or tissue replacement.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Apr
Agricultural by-products and oyster shell as alternative nutrient sources for microbial sealing of early age cracks in mortar.,"Bio-concrete using bacterially produced calcium carbonate can repair microcracks but is still relatively expensive due to the addition of bacteria, nutrients, and calcium sources. Agricultural by-products and oyster shells were used to produce economical bio-concrete. Sesame meal was the optimal agricultural by-product for low-cost spore production of the alkaliphilic Bacillus miscanthi strain AK13. Transcriptomic dataset was utilized to compare the gene expressions of AK13 strain under neutral and alkaline conditions, which suggested that NaCl and riboflavin could be chosen as growth-promoting factors at alkaline pH. The optimal levels of sesame meal, NaCl, and riboflavin were induced with the central composite design to create an economical medium, in which AK13 strain formed more spores with less price than in commercial sporulation medium. Calcium nitrate obtained from nitric acid treatment of oyster shell powder increased the initial compressive strength of cement mortar. Non-ureolytic calcium carbonate precipitation by AK13 using oyster shell-derived calcium ions was verified by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction analysis. Stereomicroscope and field emission scanning electron microscopy confirmed that oyster shell-derived calcium ions, along with soybean meal-solution, increased the bacterial survival and calcium carbonate precipitation inside mortar cracks. These data suggest the possibility of commercializing bacterial self-healing concrete with economical substitutes for culture medium, growth nutrient, and calcium sources.",AMB Express,eng,2021,Jan
Construction of Processable Ultrastiff Hydrogel for Periarticular Fracture Strutting and Healing.,"Development of bioactive bone and joint implants that offer superior mechanical properties to facilitate personalized surgical procedures remains challenging in the field of biomedical materials. As for the hydrogel, mechanical property and processability are major obstructions hampering its application as load-bearing scaffolds in orthopedics. Herein, we constructed implantable composite hydrogels with appealing processability and ultrahigh stiffness. Central to our design is the incorporation of a thixotropic composite network into an elastic polymer network via dynamic interactions to synthesize a percolation-structured double-network (DN) hydrogel with plasticity, followed by in situ strengthening and self-strengthening mechanisms for fostering the DN structure to the cojoined-network structure and subsequently mineralized-composite-network structure to harvest excellent stiffness. The ultrastiff hydrogel is shapeable and can reach a compressive modulus of 80-200 MPa together with a fracture energy of 6-10 MJ/m<sup>3</sup>, comparable to the mechanical performance of cancellous bone. Moreover, the hydrogel is cytocompatible, osteogenic, and showed almost no volume shrinkage within 28 days in simulated body fluid or culture medium. Such characteristics enabled the utility of a hydrogel in the reduction and stabilization of periarticular fracture treatment on a distal femoral AO/OTA B1 fracture rabbit model and successfully avoided the recollapse of the articular surface.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2023,May

The bending strength of the material before operation is more than 200 MPa, exceeding 20-30 times the strength of cancellous bone. The material looses its mechanical strength in hydrolitic conditions during 5-6 weeks and dissolves totally during the following months.

Biotreatments Using Microbial Mixed Cultures with Crude Glycerol and Waste Pinewood as Carbon Sources: Influence of Application on the Durability of Recycled Concrete.,"Two eco-friendly healing bioproducts generated from microbial mixed cultures (MMC) for the production of polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) were used as surface treatments, with two residual materials used as the substrates, namely crude glycerol and pinewood bio-oil. Their ability to improve the durability of concrete samples containing recycled aggregates was assessed. To determine this protective capacity, 180 samples were analyzed using different tests, such as water penetration under pressure, capillary absorption, freeze-thaw and water droplet absorption test. Three types of conditions were used: outdoor-indoor exposure, re-application of biopolymers and application in vertical exposure conditions. The results showed reductions of up to 50% in the water penetration test and a delay in the water droplet absorption test of up to 150 times relative to the reference. The surface application of these bioproducts significantly reduced the degree of water penetration in recycled concrete, increasing its useful lifespan and proving to be a promising treatment for protecting concrete surfaces.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Feb
"High-Strength, Strongly Bonded Nanocomposite Hydrogels for Cartilage Repair.","Polyacrylamide-based hydrogels are widely used as potential candidates for cartilage replacement. However, their bioapplicability is sternly hampered due to their limited mechanical strength and puncture resistance. In the present work, the strength of polyacrylamide (PAM) hydrogels was increased using titanium oxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) separately and a combination of TiO<sub>2</sub> with CNTs in a PAM matrix, which was interlinked by the bonding between nanoparticles and polymers with the deployment of density functional theory (DFT) approach. The synergistic effect and strong interfacial bonding of TiO<sub>2</sub> and CNT nanoparticles with PAM are attributed to high compressive strength, elastic modulus (>0.43 and 2.340 MPa, respectively), and puncture resistance (estimated using the needle insertion test) for the PAM-TiO<sub>2</sub>-CNT hydrogel. The PAM-TiO<sub>2</sub>-CNT composite hydrogel revealed a significant self-healing phenomenon along with a sign toward the bioactivity and cytocompatibility by forming the apatite crystals in simulated body fluid as well as showing a cell viability of ∼99%, respectively. Furthermore, for new insights on interfacial bonding and structural and electronic features involved in the hydrogels, DFT was used. The PAM-TiO<sub>2</sub>-CNT composite model, constructed by two interfaces (PAM-TiO<sub>2</sub> and PAM-CNT), was stabilized by H-bonding and van der Waals-type interactions. Employing the NCI plot, HOMO-LUMO gap, and natural population analysis tools, the PAM-TiO<sub>2</sub>-CNT composite has been found to be most stable. Therefore, the prepared polyacrylamide hydrogels in combination with the TiO<sub>2</sub> and CNT can be a remarkable nanocomposite hydrogel for cartilage repair applications.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2021,Jun

A Highly Stretchable and Real-Time Healable Supercapacitor.,"In addition to a high specific capacitance, a large stretchability and self-healing properties are also essential to improve the practicality and reliability of supercapacitors in portable and wearable electronics. However, the integration of multiple functions into one device remains challenging. Here, the construction of a highly stretchable and real-time omni-healable supercapacitor is demonstrated by sandwiching the polypyrrole-incorporated gold nanoparticle/carbon nanotube (CNT)/poly(acrylamide) (GCP@PPy) hydrogel electrodes with a CNT-free GCP (GP) hydrogel as the electrolyte and chemically soldering an Ag nanowire film to the hydrogel electrode as the current collector. The newly developed dynamic metal-thiolate (M-SR, M = Au, Ag) bond-induced integrated configuration, with an intrinsically powerful electrode and electrolyte, enables the assembled supercapacitor to deliver an areal capacitance of 885 mF cm<sup>-2</sup> and an energy density of 123 µWh cm<sup>-2</sup> , which are among the highest-reported values for stretchable supercapacitors. Notably, the device exhibits a superhigh stretching strain of 800%, rapid optical healing capability, and significant real-time healability during the charge-discharge process. The exceptional performance combined with the facile assembly method confirms this multifunctional device as the best performer among all the flexible supercapacitors reported to date.","Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)",eng,2019,May
Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Homologous Sulfide Heterojunction for Robust Enzyme-Like Self-Driven Bacteria-Killing through Enhanced Electron Transfer.,"Infectious diseases caused by various bacteria pose a serious threat to human health, and the emergence of drug-resistant bacteria has forced humans to develop new and effective antimicrobial agents and strategies. Herein, a metal-organic framework-derived Bi<sub>2</sub> S<sub>3</sub> /FeS<sub>2</sub> heterojunction (BFS) is synthesized, and the materials-microorganism interface is further constructed. Through interfacial electron transfer, electrons are transferred from the bacteria to the BFS surface, disrupting the balance of the bacterial electron transport chain and inhibiting the metabolic activity of the bacteria. Moreover, BFS has enzyme-like (oxidase and peroxidase) properties and can produce a large amount of reactive oxygen species to kill additional bacteria. In vitro antibacterial results show that the antibacterial efficiency of BFS against both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli reaches more than 99.9% after 4 h of co-culture under dark conditions. Meanwhile, in vivo experiments show that BFS can effectively kill bacteria and promote wound healing.

Two-dimensional semiconducting covalent organic frameworks via condensation at arylmethyl carbon atoms.,"Construction of organic semiconducting materials with in-plane π-conjugated structures and robustness through carbon-carbon bond linkages, alternatively as organic graphene analogs, is extremely desired for powerfully optoelectrical conversion. However, the poor reversibility for sp<sup>2</sup> carbon bond forming reactions makes them unavailable for building high crystalline well-defined organic structures through a self-healing process, such as covalent organic frameworks (COFs).

Development of highly-reproducible hydrogel based bioink for regeneration of skin-tissues via 3-D bioprinting technology.,"3-D Bioprinting is employed as a novel approach in biofabrication to promote skin regeneration following chronic-wounds and injury. A novel bioink composed of carbohydrazide crosslinked {polyethylene oxide-co- Chitosan-co- poly(methylmethacrylic-acid)} (PEO-CS-PMMA) laden with Nicotinamide and human dermal fibroblast was successfully synthesized via Free radical-copolymerization at 73 °C. The developed bioink was characterized in term of swelling, structural-confirmation by solid state 13C-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), morphology, thermal, 3-D Bioprinting via extrusion, rheological and interaction with DNA respectively. The predominant rate of gelation was attributed to the electrostatic interactions between cationic CS and anionic PMMA pendant groups. The morphology of developed bioink presented a porous architecture satisfying the cell and growth-factor viability across the barrier. The thermal analysis revealed two-step degradation with 85 % weight loss in term of decomposition and molecular changes in the bioink moieties By applying low pressure in the range of 25-50 kPa, the optimum reproducibility and printability were determined at 37 °C in the viscosity range of 500-550 Pa. s.

<i>In situ</i> self-assembly of polydopamine inside injectable hydrogels: antibacterial activity and photothermal therapy for superbug-infected wound healing.,"Inspired by the mussel foot proteins, polydopamine nanoparticles (PDA NPs) are often used to design hydrogel wound dressings due to their strong wet adhesion. However, additional antibiotics or nanometal bactericides are always required to enhance their poor antibacterial activity, which will cause drug resistance and toxic side effects. Herein, self-assembly confined PDA NPs (SC-PDA NPs, <50 nm) are employed as a freestanding antibacterial ingredient for constructing an ideal hydrogel wound dressing, which maintains relatively strong reducibility and size effect. Through a rapid gelation (within 10 s) strategy triggered by electrostatic complexation, an antibacterial hydrogel system is obtained, in which the <i>in situ</i> self-assembly of the SC-PDA NPs continues, endowing the gel with outstanding antibacterial activity, especially against methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA, >99.9%). With the continuous <i>in situ</i> self-assembly, the size of the PDA NPs increases (>200 nm), eventually giving the gel an efficient photothermal therapy effect. Moreover, the gel presents a relatively strong wet adhesion (63 kPa), superior biocompatibility and non-immunogenicity. This work offers innovative insights into the antibacterial mechanism of SC-PDA NPs and provides a novel design for constructing safe antibacterial hydrogel wound dressings, demonstrating great potential applications in superbug-infected wound healing.",Biomaterials science,eng,2022,Jul
Bacterial infection microenvironment-responsive enzymatically degradable multilayer films for multifunctional antibacterial properties.,"The adhesion of bacteria is one of the most important stages in biofilm formation and bacterial infection. Once bacteria have adhered to a biomaterial surface, it is hard to eliminate them, and bacterial growth and infection are inevitable. In the current study, we have designed and constructed enzymatically degradable (hyaluronic acid/chitosan)<sub>n</sub>-(hyaluronic acid/polylysine)<sub>n</sub> ((HA/CHI)<sub>n</sub>-(HA/PLL)<sub>n</sub>) composite multilayer films via a layer-by-layer self-assembly method. Spectroscopic ellipsometry and scanning electron microscopy cross section measurements showed the exponential growth behavior of (HA/CHI)<sub>10</sub>-(HA/PLL)<sub>10</sub> multilayer films (∼2 μm). The increased secretion of hyaluronidase and chymotrypsin in the bacterial infection microenvironment led to the fast degradation of the outer (PLL/HA)<sub>n</sub> multilayer films in the first 24 h. Enzymatic degradation of the multilayer films efficiently reduced the adhesion of both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli (>99%). Bacterial live/dead staining demonstrated the bactericidal action of the remaining bottom (CHI/HA)<sub>n</sub> multilayer films against the two kinds of bacteria. In vivo subcutaneous tests on New Zealand white rabbits, wound appearance and histopathology analysis showed that the implantation of composite multilayer film-modified PDMS promoted wound healing and the materials demonstrated a self-defense antibacterial effect.

Self-assembling peptide-polymer hydrogels designed from the coiled coil region of fibrin.,"Biomaterials constructed from self-assembling peptides, peptide derivatives, and peptide-polymer conjugates are receiving increasing attention as defined matrices for tissue engineering, controlled therapeutic release, and in vitro cell expansion, but many are constructed from peptide structures not typically found in the human extracellular matrix. Here we report a self-assembling biomaterial constructed from a designed peptide inspired by the coiled coil domain of human fibrin, the major protein constituent of blood clots and the provisional scaffold of wound healing. Targeted substitutions were made in the residues forming the interface between coiled coil strands for a 37-amino acid peptide from human fibrinogen to stabilize the coiled coil peptide bundle, while the solvent-exposed residues were left unchanged to provide a surface similar to that of the native protein. This peptide, which self-assembled into coiled coil dimers and tetramers, was then used to produce triblock peptide-PEG-peptide bioconjugates that self-assembled into viscoelastic hydrogel biomaterials.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2008,Sep
Triggered Self-Sorting of Peptides to Form Higher-Order Assemblies in a Living System.,"Biological components (protein, DNA, lipid rafts, etc.) self-sort to form higher-order structures with elegant modulation by endogenous stimuli for maintaining cellular functions in living cells. However, the challenge of producing self-sorted higher-order assemblies of peptides in living systems (cells and tissues) spatiotemporally has yet to be achieved. This work reports the using of a biocompatible strategy to construct self-sorted assemblies of peptides in living cells and tumor-bearing mice. The results show that the designed peptides self-sort to form distinct nanostructures in living cancer cells using an endogenous trigger, as evidenced by confocal laser scanning microscopy and Bio-EM. Wound-healing experiments indicate that the in situ generation of self-sorted nanostructures exhibits a synergistic effect that significantly decreases the migration of cancer cells. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the designed peptides could self-sort in tumor-bearing mice and improve the tumor penetrating ability of the impenetrable component in tumor tissue. We can further program the formation of self-sorted materials through orthogonal triggers by introducing an exogenous trigger (light) and an endogenous trigger independently. Thus, this work provides a strategy to control multiple self-assembling processes in the context of the living system and provides a general strategy to construct self-sorted structures for the emergent properties of materials science.",ACS nano,eng,2022,Nov
The Improvement of Durability of Reinforced Concretes for Sustainable Structures: A Review on Different Approaches.,"The topic of sustainability of reinforced concrete structures is strictly related with their durability in aggressive environments. In particular, at equal environmental impact, the higher the durability of construction materials, the higher the sustainability. The present review deals with the possible strategies aimed at producing sustainable and durable reinforced concrete structures in different environments. It focuses on the design methodologies as well as the use of unconventional corrosion-resistant reinforcements, alternative binders to Portland cement, and innovative or traditional solutions for reinforced concrete protection and prevention against rebars corrosion such as corrosion inhibitors, coatings, self-healing techniques, and waterproofing aggregates. Analysis of the scientific literature highlights that there is no preferential way for the production of ""green"" concrete but that the sustainability of the building materials can only be achieved by implementing simultaneous multiple strategies aimed at reducing environmental impact and improving both durability and performances.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Apr
A natural polyphenol-functionalized chitosan/gelatin sponge for accelerating hemostasis and infected wound healing.,"Natural polymers have been particularly appealing for constructing hemostatic materials/devices, but it is still desirable to develop new natural polymer-based biomaterials with balanced hemostatic and wound-healing performance. In this work, a natural polyphenol-functionalized chitosan/gelatin sponge (PCGS) was prepared by the lyophilization of a chitosan/gelatin mixture solution (under a self-foaming condition to prepare the CGS) and subsequent chemical cross-linking with procyanidin (PC). Compared with the original CGS, PCGS exhibited an enhanced liquid-absorption ability, reduced surface charges, and similar/low hemolysis rate. Benefiting from such a liquid-absorption ability (∼4000% for whole blood and normal saline) and moderate surface charges, PCGS exhibited high <i>in vitro</i> hemostatic property and promising hemostatic performance in an <i>in vivo</i> femoral-artery-injury model. In addition, PCGS possessed higher antioxidant property and slightly decreased antibacterial ability than CGS, owing to the incorporation of PC. The feasibility of PCGS for treating infected wounds was further confirmed in an <i>in vivo</i> infected-tooth-extraction model, as the typical complication of intractable tooth-extraction bleeding. The present work demonstrated a facile approach for developing multifunctional hemostatic materials through the flexible management of natural polymers and polyphenols.",Biomaterials science,eng,2023,Mar
Human skin cell fractions fail to self-organize within a gellan gum/hyaluronic acid matrix but positively influence early wound healing.,"Split-thickness autografts still are the current gold standard to treat skin, upon severe injuries. Nonetheless, autografts are dependent on donor site availability and often associated to poor quality neoskin. The generation of dermal-epidermal substitutes by tissue engineering is seen as a promising strategy to overcome this problematic. However, solutions that can be safely and conveniently transplanted in one single surgical intervention are still very challenging as their production normally requires long culture time, and graft survival is many times compromised by delayed vascularization upon transplantation. This work intended to propose a strategy that circumvents the prolonged and laborious preparation period of skin substitutes and allows skin cells self-organization toward improved healing. Human dermal/epidermal cell fractions were entrapped directly from isolation within a gellan gum/hyaluronic acid (GG-HA) spongy-like hydrogel formed from an off-the-shelf dried polymeric network. Upon transplantation into full-thickness mice wounds, the proposed constructs accelerated the wound closure rate and re-epithelialization, as well as tissue neovascularization. A synergistic effect of the GG-HA matrix and the transplanted cells over those processes was demonstrated at early time points. Despite the human-derived and chimeric blood vessels found, the proposed matrix did not succeed in prolonging cells residence time and in sustaining the self-organization of transplanted human cells possibly due to primitive degradation. Despite this, the herein proposed approach open the opportunity to tackle wound healing at early stages contributing to re-epithelialization and neovascularization.",Tissue engineering.

Emerging Functional Biomaterials as Medical Patches.,"Medical patches have been widely explored and applied in various medical fields, especially in wound healing, tissue engineering, and other biomedical areas. Benefiting from emerging biomaterials and advanced manufacturing technologies, great achievements have been made on medical patches to evolve them into a multifunctional medical device for diverse health-care purposes, thus attracting extensive attention and research interest. Here, we provide up-to-date research concerning emerging functional biomaterials as medical patches. An overview of the various approaches to construct patches with micro- and nanoarchitecture is presented and summarized.

The challenges and prospects for the future development of the medical patches are also discussed.",ACS nano,eng,2021,Apr
Tissue-engineered skin substitutes: an overview.,"Extensive skin loss and chronic wounds are still a significant challenge to clinicians: even if injured epidermis is normally able to self-renew, deep injuries can cause negative regulation of the wound healing cascade, leading to chronic wound formation. Skin-autografting surgical procedures are often limited by the poor availability of healthy tissue, whereas the use of non-self-tissues for allografts presents some severe risks. Tissue-engineered skin substitutes have recently become viable as a suitable alternative to auto- and allografts. However, biologists, biochemists, and technical engineers are still struggling to produce complex skin substitutes that can readily be transplanted in large quantities. The ambitious goal is now to construct a dermoepidermal substitute that rapidly vascularizes and optimally supports a stratifying epidermal graft on a biodegradable matrix. This review analyzes these aspects in light of the available literature and the authors' experience.",Journal of artificial organs : the official journal of the Japanese Society for Artificial Organs,eng,2013,Dec
Increased recruitment of endogenous stem cells and chondrogenic differentiation by a composite scaffold containing bone marrow homing peptide for cartilage regeneration.,"Even small cartilage defects could finally degenerate to osteoarthritis if left untreated, owing to the poor self-healing ability of articular cartilage. Stem cell transplantation has been well implemented as a common approach in cartilage tissue engineering but has technical complexity and safety concerns. The stem cell homing-based technique emerged as an alternative promising therapy for cartilage repair to overcome traditional limitations. In this study, we constructed a composite hydrogel scaffold by combining an oriented acellular cartilage matrix (ACM) with a bone marrow homing peptide (BMHP)-functionalized self-assembling peptide (SAP). We hypothesized that increased recruitment of endogenous stem cells by the composite scaffold could enhance cartilage regeneration. <b>Methods:</b> To test our hypothesis, <i>in vitro</i> proliferation, attachment and chondrogenic differentiation of rabbit mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) were tested to confirm the bioactivities of the functionalized peptide hydrogel. The composite scaffold was then implanted into full-thickness cartilage defects on rabbit knee joints for cartilage repair, in comparison with microfracture or other sample groups. Stem cell recruitment was monitored by dual labeling with CD29 and CD90 under confocal microcopy at 1 week after implantation, followed by chondrogenic differentiation examined by qRT-PCR. Repaired tissue of the cartilage defects was evaluated by histological and immunohistochemistry staining, microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 and 6 months post-surgery. Macroscopic and histological scoring was done to evaluate the optimal <i>in vivo</i> repair outcomes of this composite scaffold. <b>Results:</b> The functionalized SAP hydrogels could stimulate rabbit MSC proliferation, attachment and chondrogenic differentiation during <i>in vitro</i> culture. At 7 days after implantation, increased recruitment of MSCs based on CD29<sup>+</sup> /CD90<sup>+</sup> double-positive cells was found <i>in vivo</i> in the composite hydrogel scaffold, as well as upregulation of cartilage-associated genes (aggrecan, Sox9 and type II collagen). After 3 and 6 months post-surgery, the articular cartilage defect in the composite scaffold-treated group was fully covered with cartilage-like tissue with a smooth surface, which was similar to the surrounding native cartilage, according to the results of histological and immunohistochemistry staining, micro-CT and MRI analysis. Macroscopic and histological scoring confirmed that the quality of cartilage repair was significantly improved with implantation of the composite scaffold at each timepoint, in comparison with microfracture or other sample groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings demonstrated that the composite scaffold could enhance endogenous stem cell homing and chondrogenic differentiation and significantly improve the therapeutic outcome of chondral defects. The present study provides a promising approach for <i>in vivo</i> cartilage repair without cell transplantation. Optimization of this strategy may offer great potential and benefits for clinical application in the future.",Theranostics,eng,2018,No Data

Prolonged Thermal Relaxation of the Thermosetting Polymers.,"The rigidity of structures made of polymer composite materials, operated at elevated temperatures, is mainly determined by the residual rigidity of the polymer binder (which is very sensitive to elevated temperatures); therefore, the study of ways to increase the rigidity of polymer materials under heating (including prolonged heating) is relevant. In the previous research, cured thermosetting polymer structure's non-stability, especially under heating, is determined by its supra-molecular structure domain's conglomerate character and the high entropy of such structures. The polymer elasticity modeling proved the significance of the entropy factor and layer (EPL) model application. The prolonged heating makes it possible to release adsorptive inter-layer bonds and volatile groups. As a result, the polymer structure is changing, and inner stress relaxation occurs due to this thermo-process, called thermo-relaxation. The present study suggests researching thermo-relaxation's influence on polymers' deformability under load and heating. The research results prove the significant polymer structure modification due to thermo-relaxation, with the polymer entropy parameter decreasing, the glassing onset temperature point (Tg) increasing by 1.3-1.7 times, and the modulus of elasticity under heating increasing by 1.5-2 times.",Polymers,eng,2021,Nov
Bacterial microenvironment-responsive dual-channel smart imaging-guided on-demand self-regulated photodynamic/chemodynamic synergistic sterilization and wound healing.,"Bacterial infections pose a serious threat to public health. The integration of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has emerged as a promising means to combat bacterial infection. However, most photosensitizers are often in the ""always on"" activated state and lack bacterial targeting, leading to non-specific damage to normal tissues. Besides, most of the conventional CDT systems are directly complexed with metal ions. The toxicity of excess free metal ions cannot be ignored. Therefore, it is a huge challenge to construct a bacteria-specific activated PDT/CDT synergistic therapy platform to achieve precise sterilization. Herein, we report a bacterial microenvironment-responsive phosphorescence/fluorescence dual-channel smart imaging-guided on-demand self-regulating CDT/PDT theranostic platform for precise sterilization and wound healing. Acid-degradable persistent luminescence nanoparticles were prepared as bacterial microenvironment-responsive phosphorescence imaging units and CDT agents. Piperazine-modified PEG was then introduced as an intelligent targeting and hydrophilic group, which was further bonded with a pH-reversibly-activated fluorescence/PDT-in-one probe to construct the intelligent theranostic platform. The developed platform combines the features of good biocompatibility, prolonged blood circulation, charge-reversed intelligent targetability, dual-channel smart imaging and on-demand self-regulating CDT/PDT effect, holding great potential for precise imaging-guided bacteria-specific synergistic sterilization without side effects.",Biomaterials science,eng,2022,May
Multifunctional porous hydrogen-bonded organic framework materials.,"Hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) represent an interesting type of polymeric porous materials that can be self-assembled through H-bonding between organic linkers. To realize permanent porosity in HOFs, stable and robust open frameworks can be constructed by judicious selection of rigid molecular building blocks and hydrogen-bonded units with strong H-bonding interactions, in which the framework stability might be further enhanced through framework interpenetration and other types of weak intermolecular interactions such as ππ interactions. Owing to the reversible and flexible nature of H-bonding connections, HOFs show high crystallinity, solution processability, easy healing and purification. These unique advantages enable HOFs to be used as a highly versatile platform for exploring multifunctional porous materials. Here, the bright potential of HOF materials as multifunctional materials is highlighted in some of the most important applications for gas storage and separation, molecular recognition, electric and optical materials, chemical sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine.",Chemical Society reviews,eng,2019,Mar
Peptide Self-Assembly for Crafting Functional Biological Materials.,"Self-assembling, peptide-based scaffolds are frontrunners in the search for biomaterials with widespread impact in regenerative medicine. The inherent biocompatibility and cell signaling capabilities of peptides, in combination with control of secondary structure, has led to the development of a broad range of functional materials with potential for many novel therapies. More recently, membranes formed through complexation of peptide nanostructures with natural biopolymers have led to the development of hierarchically-structured constructs with potentially far-reaching applications in biology and medicine. In this review, we highlight recent advances in peptide-based gels and membranes, including work from our group and others. Specifically, we discuss the application of peptide-based materials in the regeneration of bone and enamel, cartilage, and the central nervous system, as well as the transplantation of islets, wound-healing, cardiovascular therapies, and treatment of erectile dysfunction after prostatectomy.",Current opinion in solid state & materials science,eng,2011,Dec
Analysis of the Theory of Integrative Nurse Coaching.,"The Theory of Integrative Nurse Coaching (TINC) has been analyzed according to the method of Walker and Avant. We have found that TINC is a well-constructed mid-range theory in the discipline of nursing. Within the domain of holistic nursing, it is focused on the goal of healing the whole person, synthesizing a large amount of theoretical material related to the concept of healing and placing it within the context of nursing as a discipline. With underpinnings in holistic nursing, it aligns with numerous grand nursing theories via the metaparadigm, healing, and patterns of knowing. It is easily translated into holistic nursing practice, actualized in the role of the nurse coach. It describes a method of holistic nursing practice that is suitable for use in numerous settings, including lifestyle, chronic disease, and end of life, among others. Although there is little published research using the theory, there is potential for application in holistic nursing practice, education, research, policy, and administration. We have identified numerous potential research questions that would test the theory. In this time of global nursing shortage and burnout, it is notable that this mid-range theory explicitly describes how self-care of the nurse enhances client care.",Journal of holistic nursing : official journal of the American Holistic Nurses' Association,eng,2022,Jun

Constructing core-shell structured BaTiO<sub>3</sub>@carbon boosts piezoelectric activity and cell response of polymer scaffolds.,"Piezoelectric composites have shown great potential in constructing electrical microenvironment for bone healing since their integration of polymer flexibility and ceramic piezoelectric coefficient. Herein, core-shell structured BaTiO<sub>3</sub>@carbon (BT@C) hybrid nanoparticles were prepared by in situ oxidative self-polymerization and template carbonization. Then the BT@C was introduced into polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) scaffolds manufactured by selective laser sintering. On one hand, the carbon shell could strengthen the local electric field loaded on BT in poling process owing to it served as a diffusion layer to provide space for charge transfer and accumulation. In this case, more electric domain within BT would be aligned along the polarization field direction and thus promoted the paly of BT's piezoelectric activity. On the other hand, the carbon shell could induce the formation of β phase due to the sp<sup>2</sup> hybrid-bonded carbon atoms in carbon shell forming electrostatic interaction with hydrogen atoms in PVDF chains, which further enhanced the piezoelectric response of the scaffolds. Results showed that the scaffold presented augmented piezoelectric performance with output voltage of 5.7 V and current of 79.8 nA. The improved electrical signals effectively accelerated cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, the scaffold displayed improved mechanical performance due to rigid particle strengthen effect.","Materials science & engineering. C, Materials for biological applications",eng,2021,Jul
Enhancing post-expansion chondrogenic potential of costochondral cells in self-assembled neocartilage.,"The insufficient healing capacity of articular cartilage necessitates mechanically functional biologic tissue replacements. Using cells to form biomimetic cartilage implants is met with the challenges of cell scarcity and donor site morbidity, requiring expanded cells that possess the ability to generate robust neocartilage. To address this, this study assesses the effects of expansion medium supplementation (bFGF, TFP, FBS) and self-assembled construct seeding density (2, 3, 4 million cells/5 mm dia. construct) on the ability of costochondral cells to generate biochemically and biomechanically robust neocartilage. Results show TFP (1 ng/mL TGF-β1, 5 ng/mL bFGF, 10 ng/mL PDGF) supplementation of serum-free chondrogenic expansion medium enhances the post-expansion chondrogenic potential of costochondral cells, evidenced by increased glycosaminoglycan content, decreased type I/II collagen ratio, and enhanced compressive properties. Low density (2 million cells/construct) enhances matrix synthesis and tensile and compressive mechanical properties. Combined, TFP and Low density interact to further enhance construct properties. That is, with TFP, Low density increases type II collagen content by over 100%, tensile stiffness by over 300%, and compressive moduli by over 140%, compared with High density. In conclusion, the interaction of TFP and Low density seeding enhances construct material properties, allowing for a mechanically functional, biomimetic cartilage to be formed using clinically relevant costochondral cells.",PloS one,eng,2013,No Data
Application of f-FeNC@GOx cascade enzyme nanomaterials in the healing of infected wounds.,"Bacterial infection is a significant factor contributing to the deterioration of wounds, and the misuse of antibiotics has exacerbated bacterial resistance. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a novel antibacterial strategy to replace conventional therapies. This study aims to construct a self-activated cascade reaction nanozyme, f-FeNC@GOx, which triggers a cascade reaction in the presence of glucose. This cascade reaction generates highly toxic hydroxyl radicals (OH), thereby achieving the goal of eliminating bacteria and promoting wound healing.",Life sciences,eng,2023,Sep
Coacervation-Based Method for Constructing a Multifunctional Strain-Stiffening Crystalline Polyvinylamine Hydrogel.,"Strain-stiffening hydrogels are essential in the development of ionic skin, as human skin possesses a strain-stiffening property for self-protection. Semicrystalline polymers such as poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) have been widely investigated to fabricate strain-stiffening hydrogels via freeze-thaw cycling or chemical cross-linking but with limited adjustable properties. Compared with PVA, polyvinylamine (PVAm) has a higher reactive activity, making it easier to achieve multifunctionalities including strain-stiffening in a PVAm hydrogel. However, the amine moieties in the backbone tend to be ionized and form strong ionic hydrogen bonds with water, resulting in difficulties in forming crystalline hydrogels by conventional methods. Herein, a one-pot method to induce crystallinity and achieve multifunctional hydrogel is devised via coacervation of PVAm. Different from a published coacervation method to fabricate hydrogels with various properties via noncovalent interactions between different chemicals, coacervation occurs between PVAm to form aggregated and loose PVAm in our devised system. Such a strategy lowers the amine-water binding energy in the polymer-dense phase to achieve crystallinity and subsequently the strain-stiffening property; meanwhile, self-healability, self-adhesion, and ionic conductivity can be realized in the polymer-loose phase. The obtained hydrogel integrates stretchability (∼1300% elongation), toughness (227 kPa), the strain-stiffening property (∼10 times increase), self-adhesion (90 J m<sup>-2</sup>), self-healability (∼80% healing efficiency in toughness), and ionic conductivity (0.22 mS m<sup>-1</sup>). This convenient strategy will open a new horizon to design multifunctional skin-mimic materials.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Jul
Healing parameters in a rabbit partial tendon defect following tenocyte/biomaterial implantation.,"Although rabbits are commonly used as tendon repair model, interpretative tools are divergent and comprehensive scoring systems are lacking. Hence, the aim was to develop a multifaceted scoring system to characterize healing in a partial Achilles tendon defect model. A 3 mm diameter defect was created in the midsubstance of the medial M. gastrocnemius tendon, which remained untreated or was filled with a polyglycolic-acid (PGA) scaffold + fibrin and either left cell-free or seeded with Achilles tenocytes. After 6 and 12 weeks, tendon repair was assessed macroscopically and histologically using self-constructed scores. Macroscopical scoring revealed superior results in the tenocyte seeded PGA + fibrin group compared with the controls at both time points. Histology of all operated tendons after 6 weeks proved extracellular matrix (ECM) disorganization, hypercellularity and occurrence of irregular running elastic fibres with no significance between the groups. Some inflammation was associated with PGA implantation and increased sulphated proteoglycan deposition predominantly with the empty defects. After 12 weeks defect areas became hard to recognize and differences between groups, except for the increased sulphated proteoglycans content in the empty defects, were almost nullified. We describe a partial Achilles tendon defect model and versatile scoring tools applicable for characterizing biomaterial-supported tendon healing.",Biomaterials,eng,2011,Jul
Fabricated Elastin.,"The mechanical stability, elasticity, inherent bioactivity, and self-assembly properties of elastin make it a highly attractive candidate for the fabrication of versatile biomaterials. The ability to engineer specific peptide sequences derived from elastin allows the precise control of these physicochemical and organizational characteristics, and further broadens the diversity of elastin-based applications. Elastin and elastin-like peptides can also be modified or blended with other natural or synthetic moieties, including peptides, proteins, polysaccharides, and polymers, to augment existing capabilities or confer additional architectural and biofunctional features to compositionally pure materials. Elastin and elastin-based composites have been subjected to diverse fabrication processes, including heating, electrospinning, wet spinning, solvent casting, freeze-drying, and cross-linking, for the manufacture of particles, fibers, gels, tubes, sheets and films. The resulting materials can be tailored to possess specific strength, elasticity, morphology, topography, porosity, wettability, surface charge, and bioactivity. This extraordinary tunability of elastin-based constructs enables their use in a range of biomedical and tissue engineering applications such as targeted drug delivery, cell encapsulation, vascular repair, nerve regeneration, wound healing, and dermal, cartilage, bone, and dental replacement.",Advanced healthcare materials,eng,2015,Nov
Transient regulation of gel properties by chemical reaction networks.,"Transient regulation of gel properties by chemical reaction networks (CRNs) represents an emerging and effective strategy to program or temporally control the structures, properties, and functions of gel materials in a self-regulated manner. CRNs provide significant opportunities to construct complex or sustainable gels with excellent dynamic features, thus expanding the application scope of these materials. CRN-based methods for transiently regulating the gel properties are receiving increasing attention, and the related fields are worth further studying. This feature article focuses on the CRN-mediated transient regulation of six properties of gels, which are transient gelation, transient liquefaction of gels, transient assembly of macroscopic gels, temporary actuation of gels, transient healing ability of kinetically inert gels, and cascade reaction-based self-reporting of external stimuli. Recent advances that showcase the six properties of gels controlled by CRNs are featured, the characterization and structural elucidation of gels are detailed, and the significance, achievements, and expectations of this field are discussed. The strategy of transient regulation of gel properties <i>via</i> CRNs is potentially useful for building the next generation of adaptive functional materials.","Chemical communications (Cambridge, England)",eng,2023,Aug
Biodegradable piezoelectric skin-wound scaffold.,"Electrical stimulation (ES) induces wound healing and skin regeneration. Combining ES with the tissue-engineering approach, which relies on biomaterials to construct a replacement tissue graft, could offer a self-stimulated scaffold to heal skin-wounds without using potentially toxic growth factors and exogenous cells. Unfortunately, current ES technologies are either ineffective (external stimulations) or unsafe (implanted electrical devices using toxic batteries). Hence, we propose a novel wound-healing strategy that integrates ES with tissue engineering techniques by utilizing a biodegradable self-charged piezoelectric PLLA (Poly (l-lactic acid)) nanofiber matrix. This unique, safe, and stable piezoelectric scaffold can be activated by an external ultrasound (US) to produce well-controlled surface-charges with different polarities, thus serving multiple functions to suppress bacterial growth (negative surface charge) and promote skin regeneration (positive surface charge) at the same time. We demonstrate that the scaffold activated by low intensity/low frequency US can facilitate the proliferation of fibroblast/epithelial cells, enhance expression of genes (collagen I, III, and fibronectin) typical for the wound healing process, and suppress the growth of S. aureus and P. aeruginosa bacteria in vitro simultaneously. This approach induces rapid skin regeneration in a critical-sized skin wound mouse model in vivo. The piezoelectric PLLA skin scaffold thus assumes the role of a multi-tasking, biodegradable, battery-free electrical stimulator which is important for skin-wound healing and bacterial infection prevention simultaneuosly.",Biomaterials,eng,2023,Oct
Carboxylated-xyloglucan and peptide amphiphile co-assembly in wound healing.,"Hydrogel wound dressings can play critical roles in wound healing protecting the wound from trauma or contamination and providing an ideal environment to support the growth of endogenous cells and promote wound closure. This work presents a self-assembling hydrogel dressing that can assist the wound repair process mimicking the hierarchical structure of skin extracellular matrix. To this aim, the co-assembly behaviour of a carboxylated variant of xyloglucan (CXG) with a peptide amphiphile (PA-H3) has been investigated to generate hierarchical constructs with tuneable molecular composition, structure, and properties. Transmission electron microscopy and circular dichroism at a low concentration shows that CXG and PA-H3 co-assemble into nanofibres by hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions and further aggregate into nanofibre bundles and networks. At a higher concentration, CXG and PA-H3 yield hydrogels that have been characterized for their morphology by scanning electron microscopy and for the mechanical properties by small-amplitude oscillatory shear rheological measurements and compression tests at different CXG/PA-H3 ratios. A preliminary biological evaluation has been carried out both <i>in vitro</i> with HaCat cells and <i>in vivo</i> in a mouse model.",Regenerative biomaterials,eng,2021,Oct
Mechanical Force Induced Self-Assembly of Chinese Herbal Hydrogel with Synergistic Effects of Antibacterial Activity and Immune Regulation for Wound Healing.,"Skin wounds, especially infected chronic wounds, have attracted worldwide attention due to the high prevalence and poor treatment outcomes. Hydrogel dressings with antibacterial ability and immune regulation property are urgently required. Herein, inspired by the grinding treatment of traditional Chinese medicine, mechanical force is introduced to promote the effective molecular collision and accelerate the self-assembly of chitosan (CS) and puerarin (PUE) for fabricating Chinese-herb-based hydrogels. The antibacterial rate of CS@PUE (C@P) hydrogel is more than 95%, and the wound closed rate is twice that of the control group. Interestingly, the rational design of C@P hydrogels with different PUE ratios enables a refined control over hydrogel formation, nanofiber appearance, viscoelastic, physicochemical, and biological properties. The extraordinary antibacterial ability of C@P hydrogels may originate from the nanofiber structure and the improved zeta potential on account of the orientation of amino groups in CS . Thus, the synergistically antibacterial and immune regulation properties of C@P hydrogels kill bacteria and relieve inflammation in the wound bed, ensuring the anti-infection effect, and boosting wound healing. In addition to providing a universal mechanosynthesis of PUE-based hydrogel for wound healing, this finding is expected to increase the attention paid to Chinese herbal medicines in the construction of biomaterials.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",eng,2022,May
Fibroblast-Generated Extracellular Matrix Guides Anastomosis during Wound Healing in an Engineered Lymphatic Skin Flap.,"A healthy lymphatic system is required to return excess interstitial fluid back to the venous circulation. However, up to 49% of breast cancer survivors eventually develop breast cancer-related lymphedema due to lymphatic injuries from lymph node dissections or biopsies performed to treat cancer. While early-stage lymphedema can be ameliorated by manual lymph drainage, no cure exists for late-stage lymphedema when lymph vessels become completely dysfunctional. A viable late-stage treatment is the autotransplantation of functional lymphatic vessels. Here we report on a novel engineered lymphatic flap that may eventually replace the skin flaps used in vascularized lymph vessel transfers. The engineered flap mimics the lymphatic and dermal compartments of the skin by guiding multi-layered tissue organization of mesenchymal stem cells and lymphatic endothelial cells with an aligned decellularized fibroblast matrix. The construct was tested in a novel bilayered wound healing model and implanted into athymic nude rats. The in vitro model demonstrated capillary invasion into the wound gaps and deposition of extracellular matrix fibers, which may guide anastomosis and vascular integration of the graft during wound healing. The construct successfully anastomosed in vivo, forming chimeric vessels of human and rat cells. Overall, our flap replacement has high potential for treating lymphedema.","Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2023,Jan
Effect of the Combination of Superabsorbent Polymers for Autogenous Shrinkage Control with Steel Fibers of High-Performance Concrete under Uniaxial Tension Using DIC.,"This paper presents a study of the effect of a superabsorbent polymer (SAP) for autogenous shrinkage control on the uniaxial tensile behavior of steel fiber reinforced concrete (SFRC). The use of fibers and SAP potentially increases the durability of the concrete, preventing cracking by autogenous shrinkage and enhancing post-cracking behavior. Furthermore, SAP can provide further hydration for self-healing purposes and improve the ductility of the SFRC. In order to evaluate the effect of the addition of SAP in SFRC, dog-bone SFRC specimens with different dosages of superabsorbent polymers were cast and tested under uniaxial tension. The digital image correlation (DIC) technique was used to understand the effect of SAP on the steel fibers' crack-bridging mechanisms. Surface strains and crack openings were inferred using the DIC technique. The effect of SAP and fibers on fresh and hardened concrete was individually investigated by flow tests and compressive strength tests. Autogenous shrinkage was measured in plain concrete to investigate the minimum SAP content required to mitigate autogenous shrinkage of 0.3%. The use of 0.3% SAP was also sufficient to reach multiple cracking behavior. This content of SAP completely suppressed the autogenous shrinkage with minimal side effects on compressive strength. An analytical formulation for the tensile behavior of SFRC was developed using the variable engagement model, presenting a mean correlation of R<sup>2</sup> of 0.97 with the experimental results.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2020,Oct
PCL-MECM-Based Hydrogel Hybrid Scaffolds and Meniscal Fibrochondrocytes Promote Whole Meniscus Regeneration in a Rabbit Meniscectomy Model.,"Regeneration of an injured meniscus continues to be a scientific challenge due to its poor self-healing potential. Tissue engineering provides an avenue for regenerating a severely damaged meniscus. In this study, we first investigated the superiority of five concentrations (0%, 0.5%, 1%, 2%, and 4%) of meniscus extracellular matrix (MECM)-based hydrogel in promoting cell proliferation and the matrix-forming phenotype of meniscal fibrochondrocytes (MFCs). We found that the 2% group strongly enhanced chondrogenic marker mRNA expression and cell proliferation compared to the other groups. Moreover, the 2% group showed the highest glycosaminoglycan (GAG) and collagen production by day 14. We then constructed a hybrid scaffold by 3D printing a wedge-shaped poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) scaffold as a backbone, followed by injection with the optimized MECM-based hydrogel (2%), which served as a cell delivery system. The hybrid scaffold (PCL-hydrogel) clearly yielded favorable biomechanical properties close to those of the native meniscus. Finally, PCL scaffold, PCL-hydrogel, and MFCs-loaded hybrid scaffold (PCL-hydrogel-MFCs) were implanted into the knee joints of New Zealand rabbits that underwent total medial meniscectomy. Six months postimplantation we found that the PCL-hydrogel-MFCs group exhibited markedly better gross appearance and cartilage protection than the PCL scaffold and PCL-hydrogel groups. Moreover, the regenerated menisci in the PCL-hydrogel-MFCs group had similar histological structures, biochemical contents, and biomechanical properties as the native menisci in the sham operation group. In conclusion, PCL-MECM-based hydrogel hybrid scaffold seeded with MFCs can successfully promote whole meniscus regeneration, and cell-loaded PCL-MECM-based hydrogel hybrid scaffold may be a promising strategy for meniscus regeneration in the future.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2019,Nov
Layer-by-layer self-assembly of minocycline-loaded chitosan/alginate multilayer on titanium substrates to inhibit biofilm formation.,"Bacteria adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation are primary causes of implant associated infection. The biofilm makes the bacteria highly resistant to the host defense and antimicrobial treatment. Antibacterial coatings on the surface of titanium implant can prevent biofilm formation effectively, but it is still a challenge to accomplish relatively long lasting antibacterial effects before wound healing or formation of biological seal.

It is eco-friendly, self-activated, economical, and simplistic. Bacteria inside concrete get activated by contacting the environment upon the crack opening and filling the cracks with calcium carbonate-their metabolic waste. This work systematizes MICCP's intricacies and reviews state-of-the-art literature on practical technicalities in its materialization and testing. Explored are the latest advances in various aspects of MICCP, such as bacteria species, calcium sources, encapsulations, aggregates, and the techniques of bio-calcification and curing. Furthermore, methodologies for crack formation, crack observation, property analysis of healed test subject, and present techno-economic limitations are examined. The work serves as a succinct, implementation-ready, and latest review for MICCP's application, giving tailorable control over the enormous variations in this bio-mimetic technique.",Applied biochemistry and biotechnology,eng,2023,Mar
Biomaterializing the advances in uterine tissue engineering.,"The uterus is considered to be a unique wound-healing model and distinguished by the repeated shedding of the endometrium and self-traceless regeneration. Common curettage, cesarean section, and other operations often cause endometrial and myometrial defects and obstetric and gynecological complications, leading to a high demand for uterine repair or partial replacement. However, the structure and function of the uterus are complicated. Functional uterine tissue engineering requires highly specialized biomaterials with a natural extracellular microenvironment. Currently, no biomaterial can fully simulate the structural and biomechanical properties of the uterus. Many efforts have been made to develop highly functional materials and tissue structures that may provide uterine tissue engineering constructs for reducing obstetric and gynecological complications. Continuous efforts will likely facilitate the development of scalable cells and biomaterial technologies for clinical use. This review summarizes the recent applications of biomaterials and tissue engineering in rebuilding a portion of or the entire uterus.",iScience,eng,2022,Dec
Acceleration of chondrogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells by sustained growth factor release in 3D graphene oxide incorporated hydrogels.,"Damaged articular cartilage has limited self-healing capabilities, leading to degeneration that affects millions of people. Although cartilage tissue engineering is considered a promising approach for treatment, robust and long-term chondrogenesis within a 3-dimensional (3D) scaffold remains a major challenge for complete regeneration. Most current approaches involve incorporation of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) into the scaffold, but have limited utility owing to the short functional half-life and/or rapid clearance of TGF-β. In this study, we have tested the incorporation of graphene oxide nanosheets (GO) within a photopolymerizable poly-D, l-lactic acid/polyethylene glycol (PDLLA) hydrogel, for its applicability in sustained release of the chondroinductive growth factor TGF-β3. We found that with GO incorporation, the hydrogel scaffold (GO/PDLLA) exhibited enhanced initial mechanical strength, i.e., increased compressive modulus, and supported long-term, sustained release of TGF-β3 for up to 4 weeks. In addition, human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBMSCs) seeded within TGF-β3 loaded GO/PDLLA hydrogels displayed high cell viability and improved chondrogenesis in a TGF-β3 concentration-dependent manner. hBMSCs cultured in GO/PDLLA also demonstrated significantly higher chondrogenic gene expression, including aggrecan, collagen type II and SOX9, and cartilage matrix production when compared to cultures maintained in GO-free scaffolds containing equivalent amounts of TGF-β3. Upon subcutaneous implantation in vivo, hBMSC-seeded TGF-β3-GO/PDLLA hydrogel constructs displayed considerably greater cartilage matrix than their TGF-β3/PDLLA counterparts without GO. Taken together, these findings support the potential application of GO in optimizing TGF-β3 induced hBMSC chondrogenesis for cartilage tissue engineering. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: In this work, we have developed a graphene oxide (GO) incorporated, photocrosslinked PDLLA hybrid hydrogel for localized delivery and sustained release of loaded TGF-β3 to seeded cells. The incorporation of GO in PDLLA hydrogel suppressed the burst release of TGF-β3, and significantly prolonged the retention time of the TGF-β3 initially loaded in the hydrogel. Additionally, the GO improved the initial compressive strength of the hydrogel. Both in vitro analyses and in vivo implantation results showed that the GO/PDLLA constructs seeded with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) showed significantly higher cartilage formation, compared to GO-free scaffolds containing equivalent amount of TGF-β3. Findings from this work suggest the potential application of the GO-TGF/PDLLA hydrogel as a functional scaffold for hMSC-based cartilage tissue engineering.",Acta biomaterialia,eng,2020,Mar
4D Printed Programmable Shape-Morphing Hydrogels as Intraoperative Self-Folding Nerve Conduits for Sutureless Neurorrhaphy.,"There are only a few reports of implantable 4D printed biomaterials, most of which exhibit slow deformations rendering them unsuitable for in situ surgical deployment. In this study, a hydrogel system is engineered with defined swelling behaviors, which demonstrated excellent printability in extrusion-based 3D printing and programmed shape deformations post-printing. Shape deformations of the spatially patterned hydrogels with defined infill angles are computationally predicted for a variety of 3D printed structures, which are subsequently validated experimentally. The gels are coated with gelatin-rich nanofibers to augment cell growth. 3D-printed hydrogel sheets with pre-programmed infill patterns rapidly self-rolled into tubes in vivo to serve as nerve-guiding conduits for repairing sciatic nerve defects in a rat model. These 4D-printed hydrogels minimized the complexity of surgeries by tightly clamping the resected ends of the nerves to assist in the healing of peripheral nerve damage, as revealed by histological evaluation and functional assessments for up to 45 days. This work demonstrates that 3D-printed hydrogels can be designed for programmed shape changes by swelling in vivo to yield 4D-printed tissue constructs for the repair of peripheral nerve damage with the potential to be extended in other areas of regenerative medicine.",Advanced healthcare materials,eng,2023,Sep
Modulation of hydrogel networks by metal ions.,"Self-assembling hydrogels are receiving great attention for both biomedical and technological applications. Self-assembly of protein/peptides as well as organic molecules is commonly induced in response to external triggers such as changes of temperature, concentration, or pH. An interesting strategy to modulate the morphology and mechanical properties of the gels implies the use of metal ions, where coordination bonds regulate the dynamic cross-linking in the construction of hydrogels, and coordination geometries, catalytic, and redox properties of metal ions play crucial roles. This review aims to discuss recent insights into the supramolecular assembly of hydrogels involving metal ions, with a focus on self-assembling peptides, as well as applications of metallogels in biomedical fields including tissue engineering, sensing, wound healing, and drug delivery.",Journal of peptide science : an official publication of the European Peptide Society,eng,2023,Aug
3D printing technology and applied materials in eardrum regeneration.,"Tympanic membrane perforation is a common condition in clinical otolaryngology. Although some eardrum patients can self-heal, a long period of non-healing perforation leads to persistent otitis media, conductive deafness, and poor quality of life. Tympanic membrane repair with autologous materials requires a second incision, and the sampling site may get infected. It is challenging to repair tympanic membranes while maintaining high functionality, safety, affordability, and aesthetics. 3D bioprinting can be used to fabricate tissue patches with materials, factors, and cells in a design manner. This paper reviews 3D printing technology that is being used widely in recent years to construct eardrum stents and the utilized applied materials for tympanic membrane repair. The paper begins with an introduction of the physiological structure of the tympanic membrane, briefly reviews the current clinical method thereafter, highlights the recent 3D printing-related strategies in tympanic membrane repair, describes the materials and cells that might play an important role in 3D printing, and finally provides a perspective of this field.",Journal of biomaterials science.

Cartilage regeneration using principles of tissue engineering.,"It is well known that articular cartilage in adults has a limited ability for self-repair. Numerous methods have been devised to augment its natural healing response, but these methods generally lead to filling of the defect with fibrous tissue or fibrocartilage, which lacks the mechanical characteristics of articular cartilage and fails with time. Recently, tissue engineering has emerged as a new discipline that amalgamates aspects from biology, engineering, materials science, and surgery and that has as a goal the fabrication of functional new tissues to replace damaged tissues. The emergence of tissue engineering has facilitated the generation of new concepts and the revival of old ideas all of which has allowed a fresh approach to the repair or regeneration of tissues such as cartilage. The collaborations between scientists with different backgrounds and expertise has allowed the identification of some key principles that serve as the basis for the development of therapeutic approaches that now are less empiric and more hypothesis-driven than ever before. The current authors review some of the considerations regarding the various models used to test and validate the above repair methods and to address different aspects of the cartilage repair paradigm. Also, some key principles identified from past and current research, the need for the development of new biomaterials, and considerations in scale-up of cell-biomaterial constructs are summarized.",Clinical orthopaedics and related research,eng,2001,Oct
Photoactuation Healing of α-FeOOH@g-C<sub>3</sub> N<sub>4</sub> Catalyst for Efficient and Stable Activation of Persulfate.,"Inspired by living systems, the construction of smart devices that can self-heal in response to structural damage is a promising technology for maintaining the high activity and stability of catalysts during heterocatalytic reactions. Here this study demonstrates an ingenious platform that enabled efficient persulfate (PS) activation for contaminant degradation via integrating a catalyst with photoactuation regeneration. Under irradiation, it is unambiguously confirmed that the collective properties of a tailored FeOOH@C<sub>3</sub> N<sub>4</sub> catalyst permit interfacial photoexcited electron transport from the photocatalyst substrate to needle-shaped FeOOH. This results in the simultaneous recovery of Fe(III) and optimization of the Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio on FeOOH surface during PS activation process, so that the healed chemical structure ensures that subsequent PS activation remains unimpaired. Aqueous organic contaminant (bisphenol A) oxidation efficacy in this system is almost 20 times higher than for photo- or Fenton-oxidation alone. This work highlights the concept of catalyst regeneration for stable reactive species generation in solution, which represents alternative application of photocatalysis for practical environmental remediation. Further, the photoactuation healing approach can be expanded into various domains, such as material fabrication or chemical synthesis.","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)",eng,2017,Nov

Effect of scleral buckling on unsutured cataract wound strength.,"Modern cataract surgery has evolved to include small, unsutured wounds with rapid visual rehabilitation and fewer complications. Properly constructed, these unsutured wounds can withstand increased intraocular pressures without leakage, rupture, or incarceration of intraocular contents. However, scleral buckling surgery may alter the architecture of these wounds and thus their strength.

Instant Self-Assembly Peptide Hydrogel Encapsulation with Fibrous Alginate by Microfluidics for Infected Wound Healing.,"Infected wounds caused by persistent inflammation exhibit poor vascularization and cellular infiltration. In order to rapidly control the inflammatory effect and accelerate wound healing, it is necessary to develop a novel drug vehicle addressing the need for infected wounds. Herein, we developed a novel dual-drug delivery system with micrometer-scale alginate fibers encapsulated in instant self-assembly peptide hydrogel. Short peptides with the sequence of Nap-Gly-Phe-Phe-Lys-His (Nap-GFFKH) could self-assemble outside the microfluidic-based alginate microfibers in weak acidic solution (pH ≈ 6.0) within 5 s. The gelation condition is close to the pH environment of the human skin. We further constructed recombinant bovine basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) in fibrous alginate, which was encapsulated in antibiotic-loaded peptide hydrogel. The dual-drug delivery system exhibited good mechanical property and sustained release profiles, where antibiotic could be rapidly released from the peptide hydrogel, while the growth factor could be gradually released within 7 days. Both <i>in vitro</i> antibacterial experiments and <i>in vivo</i> animal experiments confirmed that such a dual-drug delivery system has good antibacterial activity and enhances wound healing property. We suggested that the dual-drug delivery system could be potentially applied for controlled drug release in infected wound healing, drug combination for melanoma therapy, and tissue engineering.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,eng,2020,Sep
In Vitro Prevascularization of Self-Assembled Human Bone-Like Tissues and Preclinical Assessment Using a Rat Calvarial Bone Defect Model.,"In vitro prevascularization has the potential to address the challenge of maintaining cell viability at the core of engineered constructs, such as bone substitutes, and to improve the survival of tissue grafts by allowing quicker anastomosis to the host microvasculature. The self-assembly approach of tissue engineering allows the production of biomimetic bone-like tissue constructs including extracellular matrix and living human adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (hASCs) induced towards osteogenic differentiation. We hypothesized that the addition of endothelial cells could improve osteogenesis and biomineralization during the production of self-assembled human bone-like tissues using hASCs. Additionally, we postulated that these prevascularized constructs would consequently improve graft survival and bone repair of rat calvarial bone defects. This study shows that a dense capillary network spontaneously formed in vitro during tissue biofabrication after two weeks of maturation. Despite reductions in osteocalcin levels and hydroxyapatite formation in vitro in prevascularized bone-like tissues (35 days of culture), in vivo imaging of prevascularized constructs showed an improvement in cell survival without impeding bone healing after 12 weeks of implantation in a calvarial bone defect model (immunocompromised male rats), compared to their stromal counterparts. Globally, these findings establish our ability to engineer prevascularized bone-like tissues with improved functional properties.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Apr

Assessing the effect of triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate on tissue repair in 3D organotypic cultures.,"Leachables from dental restoratives induce toxicity in gingival and pulp tissues and affect tissue regeneration/healing. Appropriate testing of these materials requires a platform that mimics the in vivo environment and allows the architectural self-assembly of cells into tissue constructs. In this study, we employ a new 3D model to assess the impact of triethyleneglycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) on early organization and advanced recruitment/accumulation of immortalized mouse gingival fibroblasts (GFs) and dental papilla mesenchymal cells (DPMCs) in extracellular matrix. We hypothesize that TEGDMA (1) interferes with the developmental architecture of GFs and DPMCs, and (2) inhibits the deposition of mineral. To test these hypotheses, GFs and DPMCs were incubated with the soluble TEGDMA at concentrations (0-2.5) mmol/L. Diameter and thickness of the constructs were determined by microscopic analysis. Cell differentiation was assessed by immunocytochemistry and the secreted mineral detected by alizarin-red staining. TEGDMA interfered with the development of GFs and/or DPMCs microtissues in a dose-dependent manner by inhibiting growth of inter-spherical cell layers and decreasing spheroid size (four to six times). At low/moderate TEGDMA levels, GFs organoids retained their structures while reducing thickness up to 21%. In contrast, at low TEGDMA doses, architecture of DPMC organoids was altered and thickness decreased almost twofold. Overall, developmental ability of TEGDMA-exposed GFs and DPMCs depended on TEGDMA level. GFs constructs were more resistant to structural modifications. The employed 3D platform was proven as an efficient tool for quantifying the effects of leachables on tissue repair capacities of gingiva and dental pulp.",Journal of applied toxicology : JAT,eng,2019,Feb
Titanium Surface Priming with Phase-Transited Lysozyme to Establish a Silver Nanoparticle-Loaded Chitosan/Hyaluronic Acid Antibacterial Multilayer via Layer-by-Layer Self-Assembly.,"The formation of biofilm around implants, which is induced by immediate bacterial colonization after installation, is the primary cause of post-operation infection. Initial surface modification is usually required to incorporate antibacterial agents on titanium (Ti) surfaces to inhibit biofilm formation. However, simple and effective priming methods are still lacking for the development of an initial functional layer as a base for subsequent coatings on titanium surfaces. The purpose of our work was to establish a novel initial layer on Ti surfaces using phase-transited lysozyme (PTL), on which multilayer coatings can incorporate silver nanoparticles (AgNP) using chitosan (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) via a layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly technique.",PloS one,eng,2016,No Data
The use of biodegradable polymers in design of cellular scaffolds.,"The objective of this work was to demonstrate the usage of biodegradable polymers, made of calcium alginate and dibutyrylchitin, in the design of cellular scaffolds having broad application in reconstructive therapy (dentistry, orthopedics). To visualize cells seeded on calcium alginate and dibutyrylchitin polymers DAPI staining of fibroblasts nuclei was used. The cytotoxicity of the materials and microscopic evaluation of the viability of seeded cells was tested with a PKH 67 fluorescent dye. To assess the cellular toxicity the proliferation of fibroblasts adjacent to the tested polymers was examined. The vitability of cells seeded on polymers was also evaluated by measuring the fluorescence intensity of calcein which binds only to live cells. The conducted experiments (DAPI and PKH 67 staining) show that the tested materials have a positive influence on cell adhesion crucial for wound healing - fibroblasts. The self-made dibutyrylchitin dressing do not cause the reduction of viability of cells seeded on them. The in vitro study illustrated the interactions between the tested materials, constructed of calcium alginate or dibutyrylchitin and mouse fibroblasts and proved their usefulness in the design of cellular scaffolds. Examined polymers turned out to be of great interest and promise for cellular scaffolds design.",Postepy higieny i medycyny doswiadczalnej (Online),eng,2015,Mar

Nanofibrous asymmetric membranes self-organized from chemically heterogeneous electrospun mats for skin tissue engineering.,"Asymmetric membranes, which mimic the structure and functions of human skin, have been extensively pursued as ideal skin tissue engineering constructs. In this study, we demonstrated that nanostructured asymmetric membranes can be prepared by the self-organization of chemically heterogeneous bilayer electrospun membranes in aqueous solutions. Structurally, the skin layer consists of hydrophobic β-glucan butyrate nanofibers and its inner layer consists of hydrophilic β-glucan acetate nanofibers. After the electrospinning process, both of the layers are in a dense state. When placed in water, the skin layer absorbs little water and still remains dense, but the fibers in the inner layer become extensively hydrated and spontaneously reorganize into a fully stretched structure, resulting in a significant volume increase and a density decrease of the inner layer. SEM imaging showed that β-glucan ester nanofibers exhibited a bead-free and uniform structure. Contact angle measurement and swelling tests showed that the inner layer was highly hydrophilic with extensive swelling, but the skin layer was highly hydrophobic with little swelling. Mechanical tests indicated that the nanofibrous asymmetric membranes had good mechanical properties in both the dry and wet states. In vitro cytocompatibility tests showed that nanofibrous asymmetric membranes could promote the adhesion and proliferation of fibroblasts and keratinocytes. A preliminary in vivo study performed on a full thickness mouse skin wound model demonstrated that the nanofibrous asymmetric membranes significantly accelerated the wound healing process by promoting re-epithelialization, tissue remodeling and collagen deposition. Taken together, our study provides a novel model for the design and fabrication of nanostructured asymmetric membranes, and our β-glucan based nanofibrous asymmetric membranes could be used as an advanced platform for skin tissue engineering.","Biomedical materials (Bristol, England)",eng,2016,Jun
"Scleral ossicles: angiogenic scaffolds, a novel biomaterial for regenerative medicine applications.","Given the current prolonged life expectancy, various pathologies affect increasingly the aging subjects. Regarding the musculoskeletal apparatus, bone fragility induces more susceptibility to fractures, often not accompanied by good ability of self-repairing, in particular when critical-size defects (CSD) occur. Currently orthopedic surgery makes use of allografting and autografting which, however, have limitations due to the scarce amount of tissue that can be taken from the donor, the possibility of disease transmission and donor site morbidity. The need to develop new solutions has pushed the field of tissue engineering (TE) research to study new scaffolds to be functionalized in order to obtain constructs capable of promoting tissue regeneration and achieve stable bone recovery over time. This investigation focuses on the most important aspect related to bone tissue regeneration: the angiogenic properties of the scaffold to be used. As an innovative solution, scleral ossicles (SOs), previously characterized as natural, biocompatible and spontaneously decellularized scaffolds used for bone repair, were tested for angiogenic potential and biocompatibility. To reach this purpose, in ovo Chorioallantoic Membrane Assay (CAM) was firstly used to test the angiogenic potential; secondly, in vivo subcutaneous implantation of SOs (in a rat model) was performed in order to assess the biocompatibility and the inflammatory response. Finally, thanks to the analysis of mass spectrometry (LCMSQE), the putative proteins responsible for the SO angiogenic properties were identified. Thus, a novel natural biomaterial is proposed, which is (i) able to induce an angiogenic response in vivo by subcutaneous implantation in a non-immunodeficient animal model, (ii) which does not induce any inflammatory response, and (iii) is useful for regenerative medicine application for the healing of bone CSD.",Biomaterials science,eng,2019,Dec
"Validation of a femoral critical size defect model for orthotopic evaluation of bone healing: a biomechanical, veterinary and trauma surgical perspective.","Numerous in vivo studies have been conducted to investigate bone regeneration in orthotopic defect models, but a reliably standardized critical-size defect (CSD) model in small animals is still lacking in tissue-engineering research. Utilizing the expertise of trauma surgeons, veterinary surgeons, and engineers, we evaluated the optimal fixation strategy for in vivo application in terms of surgical suitability and conducted biomechanical studies for 3 fixation devices. Fixation strategies were an external fixation device made of polymethylmethacrylate, widely used in animal care; a self-constructed external clamp-fixation device, designed and manufactured using rapid prototyping techniques; and commercially available 1.2-mm titanium plates used in hand surgery. The CSD was 6 mm in size. Biomechanical testing included compression, 4-point bending, and torsion tests. The surgical procedure was optimized in vitro and validated in a clinical setting in athymic rats in vivo. Despite differences in the results of the biomechanical tests, all fixation devices tested proved suitable for the intended purpose. In conclusion, the evaluated model for stabilizing a CSD in a rat's femur can reliably be used for standardized bone regeneration studies in small animals.","Tissue engineering.

Fabrication of CO-releasing surface to enhance the blood compatibility and endothelialization of TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes on titanium surface.,"Although the construction of nanotube arrays with the micro-nano structures on the titanium surfaces has demonstrated a great promise in the field of blood-contacting materials and devices, the limited surface hemocompatibility and delayed endothelial healing should be further improved. Carbon monoxide (CO) gas signaling molecule within the physiological concentrations has excellent anticoagulation and the ability to promote endothelial growth, exhibiting the great potential for the blood-contact biomaterials, especially the cardiovascular devices. In this study, the regular titanium dioxide nanotube arrays were firstly prepared in situ on the titanium surface by anodic oxidation, followed by the immobilization of the complex of sodium alginate/carboxymethyl chitosan (SA/CS) on the self-assembled modified nanotube surface, the CO-releasing molecule (CORM-401) was finally grafted onto the surface to create a CO-releasing bioactive surface to enhance the biocompatibility. The results of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray energy dispersion spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) revealed that the CO-releasing molecules were successfully immobilized on the surface. The modified nanotube arrays not only exhibited excellent hydrophilicity but also could slowly release CO gas molecules, and the amount of CO release increased when cysteine was added. Furthermore, the nanotube array can promote albumin adsorption while inhibit fibrinogen adsorption to some extent, demonstrating its selective albumin adsorption; although this effect was somewhat reduced by the introduction of CORM-401, it can be significantly enhanced by the catalytic release of CO. The results of hemocompatibility and endothelial cell growth behaviors showed that, as compared with the CORM-401 modified sample, although the SA/CS-modified sample had better biocompatibility, in the case of cysteine-catalyzed CO release, the released CO could not only reduce the platelet adhesion and activation as well as hemolysis rate, but also promote endothelial cell adhesion and proliferation as well as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide (NO) expression. As a result, the research of the present study demonstrated that the releasing CO from TiO<sub>2</sub> nanotubes can simultaneously enhance the surface hemocompatibility and endothelialization, which could open a new route to enhance the biocompatibility of the blood-contacting materials and devices, such as the artificial heart valve and cardiovascular stents.",Biomaterials advances,eng,2023,Jun
A ruthenium nanoframe/enzyme composite system as a self-activating cascade agent for the treatment of bacterial infections.,"The cascade catalytic strategy could effectively enhance the antibacterial activity by regulating the production of hydroxyl radicals (˙OH) in the sites of bacterial infection. In this work, a ruthenium metal nanoframe (Ru NF) was successfully synthesized <i>via</i> the palladium template method. The cascade catalysis in the bacterial infection microenvironment was achieved by physically adsorbed natural glucose oxidase (GOx), and hyaluronic acid (HA) was coated on the outer layer of the system for locating the infection sites accurately. Eventually, a composite nano-catalyst (HA-Ru NFs/GOx) based on the ruthenium nanoframe was constructed, which exhibited excellent cascade catalytic activity and good biocompatibility. The prepared HA-Ru NFs/GOx enhances the antibacterial activity and inhibits bacterial regeneration through the outbreak of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by self-activating cascade reactions. In addition, <i>in vivo</i> experiments indicate that HA-Ru NFs/GOx could efficiently cause bacterial death and significantly promote wound healing/skin regeneration. Accordingly, ruthenium metal framework nanozymes could be used as an effective cascade catalytic platform to inhibit bacterial regeneration and promote wound healing, and have great potential as new antibacterial agents against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.",Nanoscale,eng,2021,Sep
Self-Adhesive Hyaluronic Acid/Antimicrobial Peptide Composite Hydrogel with Antioxidant Capability and Photothermal Activity for Infected Wound Healing.,"Bacterial infection can delay wound healing, causing wounds to deteriorate and even threaten the patient's life. Recently, although many composite hydrogels as wound dressing have been developed, it is still highly desired to construct photothermal hydrogels with antimicrobial and antioxidant properties to accelerate the infected wound healing. In this work, a hyaluronic acid (HA)-based composite hydrogel consisting of a dopamine-substituted antimicrobial peptide (DAP) and Iron (III) ions is developed, which exhibits photothermal-assisted promotion and acceleration of healing process of bacteria-infected wounds. DAP, serving as both antimicrobial agent and ROS-scavenger, forms Schiff's base bonds with aldehyde hyaluronic acid (AHA) and iron-catechol coordination bonds to reinforce the composite hydrogel. The presence of Fe<sup>3+</sup> can also promote covalent polymerization of dopamine, which endows the hydrogel with photothermal capacity. The in vitro and in vivo experiments prove that the composite hydrogel can effectively accelerate the infected wound healing process, including antibacterial, accelerated collagen deposition, and re-epithelization. This study suggests that the multifunctional composite hydrogel possesses remarkable potential for bacteria-infected wound healing by combining inherent antimicrobial activity, antioxidant capability, and photothermal effect.",Macromolecular rapid communications,eng,2022,Sep
Spatially Guided Construction of Multilayered Epidermal Models Recapturing Structural Hierarchy and Cell-Cell Junctions.,"A current challenge in three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting of skin equivalents is to recreate the distinct basal and suprabasal layers and to promote their direct interactions. Such a structural arrangement is essential to establish 3D stratified epidermis disease models, such as for the autoimmune skin disease pemphigus vulgaris (PV), which targets the cell-cell junctions at the interface of the basal and suprabasal layers. Inspired by epithelial regeneration in wound healing, we develop a method that combines 3D bioprinting and spatially guided self-reorganization of keratinocytes to recapture the fine structural hierarchy that lies in the deep layers of the epidermis. Here, keratinocyte-laden fibrin hydrogels are bioprinted to create geographical cues, guiding dynamic self-reorganization of cells through collective migration, keratinocyte differentiation and vertical expansion. This process results in a region of self-organized multilayers (SOMs) that contain the basal to suprabasal transition, marked by the expressed levels of different types of keratins that indicate differentiation. Finally, we demonstrate the reconstructed skin tissue as an in vitro platform to study the pathogenic effects of PV and observe a significant difference in cell-cell junction dissociation from PV antibodies in different epidermis layers, indicating their applications in the preclinical test of possible therapies.",Small science,eng,2022,Nov
Cascade enzymatic preparation of carboxymethyl chitosan-based multifunctional hydrogels for promoting cutaneous wound healing.,"Designing wound dressings with inherent multifunctional therapeutic effects is desirable for clinical applications. Herein, a series of multifunctional carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS)-based hydrogels were fabricated by the facile urate oxidase (UOX)-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) cascade enzymatic crosslinking system. For the first time, the cascade enzymatic crosslinking system was not only used for preparing hydrogel wound dressings but also for accelerating wound healing due to the activity retention of the self-compartmental enzymes. A CMCS derivative (HCMCS-mF) synthesized by successively grafting 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde (H) and 5-methylfurfural (mF) on CMCS and a quaternary ammonium crosslinker (QMal) with terminal grafting maleimide (Mal) groups were combined with enzymatic system for the facile preparation of hydrogels. The mild Diels-Alder (DA) crosslinking reaction between mF and Mal groups constructed the first network of hydrogels. The cascade UOX-HRP system mediated the oxidative crosslinking of phenols thus forming the second gel network. Self-entrapped UOX maintained its enzymatic activity and could continuously catalyze the oxidation of uric acid, generating therapeutic allantoin. These porous, degradable, mechanically stable hydrogels with excellent antioxidant performance and enhanced antibacterial capacity could effectively accelerate skin wound repair by simultaneously reducing oxidative stress, relieving inflammation, promoting collagen deposition and upregulating the expression level of CD31.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2023,Sep
A safe and efficient method to retrieve mesenchymal stem cells from three-dimensional fibrin gels.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) display multipotent characteristics that make them ideal for potential therapeutic applications. MSCs are typically cultured as monolayers on tissue culture plastic, but there is increasing evidence suggesting that they may lose their multipotency over time in vitro and eventually cease to retain any resemblance to in vivo resident MSCs. Three-dimensional (3D) culture systems that more closely recapitulate the physiological environment of MSCs and other cell types are increasingly explored for their capacity to support and maintain the cell phenotypes. In much of our own work, we have utilized fibrin, a natural protein-based material that serves as the provisional extracellular matrix during wound healing. Fibrin has proven to be useful in numerous tissue engineering applications and has been used clinically as a hemostatic material. Its rapid self-assembly driven by thrombin-mediated alteration of fibrinogen makes fibrin an attractive 3D substrate, in which cells can adhere, spread, proliferate, and undergo complex morphogenetic programs. However, there is a significant need for simple cost-effective methods to safely retrieve cells encapsulated within fibrin hydrogels to perform additional analyses or use the cells for therapy. Here, we present a safe and efficient protocol for the isolation of MSCs from 3D fibrin gels. The key ingredient of our successful extraction method is nattokinase, a serine protease of the subtilisin family that has a strong fibrinolytic activity. Our data show that MSCs recovered from 3D fibrin gels using nattokinase are not only viable but also retain their proliferative and multilineage potentials. Demonstrated for MSCs, this method can be readily adapted to retrieve any other cell type from 3D fibrin gel constructs for various applications, including expansion, bioassays, and in vivo implantation.","Tissue engineering.

Addressing thrombogenicity in vascular graft construction.,"Thrombosis is a major cause of poor patency in synthetic vascular grafts for small diameter vessel (< 6 mm) bypass. Arteries have a host of structural mechanisms by which they prevent triggering of platelet activation and the clotting cascade. Many of these are present in vascular endothelial cells. These mechanisms act together with perpetual feedback at different levels, providing a constantly fine-tuned non-thrombogenic environment. The arterial wall anatomy also serves to promote thrombosis as a healing mechanism when it has been severely injured. Surface modification of synthetic graft surfaces to attenuate the coagulation cascade has reduced thrombosis levels and improved patency in vitro and in animal models. Success in this endeavor is critically dependent on the methods used to modify the surface. Platelets adhere to positively charged surfaces due to their own negative charge. They also preferentially attach to hydrophobic surfaces. Therefore synthetic graft development is concerned with hydrophilic materials with negative surface charge. However, fibrinogen has both hydrophilic and hydrophobic binding sites-amphiphilic materials reduce its adhesion and subsequent platelet activation. The self-endothelializing synthetic graft is an attractive proposition as a confluent endothelial layer incorporates many of the anti-thrombogenic properties of arteries. Surface modification to promote this has shown good results in animal models. The difficulties experienced in achieving spontaneous endothelialisation in humans have lead to the investigation of pre-implantation in vitro endothelial cell seeding.

Electrofabrication of functional materials: Chloramine-based antimicrobial film for infectious wound treatment.,"Electrical signals can be imposed with exquisite spatiotemporal control and provide exciting opportunities to create structure and confer function. Here, we report the use of electrical signals to program the fabrication of a chloramine wound dressing with high antimicrobial activity. This method involves two electrofabrication steps: (i) a cathodic electrodeposition of an aminopolysaccharide chitosan triggered by a localized region of high pH; and (ii) an anodic chlorination of the deposited film in the presence of chloride. This electrofabrication process is completed within several minutes and the chlorinated chitosan can be peeled from the electrode to yield a free-standing film. The presence of active NCl species in this electrofabricated film was confirmed with chlorination occurring first on the amine groups and then on the amide groups when large anodic charges were used. Electrofabrication is quantitatively controllable as the cathodic input controls film growth during deposition and the anodic input controls film chlorination. In vitro studies demonstrate that the chlorinated chitosan film has antimicrobial activities that depend on the chlorination degree. In vivo studies with a MRSA infected wound healing model indicate that the chlorinated chitosan film inhibited bacterial growth, induced less inflammation, developed reorganized epithelial and dermis structures, and thus promoted wound healing compared to a bare wound or wound treated with unmodified chitosan. These results demonstrate the fabrication of advanced functional materials (i.e., antimicrobial wound dressings) using controllable electrical signals to both organize structure through non-covalent interactions (i.e., induce chitosan's reversible self-assembly) and to initiate function-conferring covalent modifications (i.e., generate chloramine bonds). Potentially, electrofabrication may provide a simple, low cost and sustainable alternative for materials fabrication.",Acta biomaterialia,eng,2018,Jun
An Ag<sub>2</sub>S@ZIF-Van nanosystem for NIR-II imaging of bacterial-induced inflammation and treatment of wound bacterial infection.,"Bacterial diseases pose a serious threat to human health. Continued development of precise diagnostic methods and synergistic therapy techniques for combating bacteria are needed. Herein a hybrid nanosystem (Ag<sub>2</sub>S@ZIF-Van NS) was constructed by one-step self-assembly of Zn<sup>2+</sup>, vancomycin (Van) and Ag<sub>2</sub>S quantum dots (QDs). The nanosystem possesses excellent second near-infrared transparency window (NIR-II) fluorescence properties (∼1200 nm emission wavelength), good photothermal conversion properties, and biocompatibility. The material system enables precise, targeted NIR-II fluorescent imaging of bacterial inflammation <i>in vivo</i> as well as promoting anti-bacterial and wound healing effects.",Biomaterials science,eng,2022,Jul
A Biocompatible Self-Powered Piezoelectric Poly(vinyl alcohol)-Based Hydrogel for Diabetic Wound Repair.,"Acute and chronic wounds, caused by trauma, tumors, diabetic foot ulcers, etc., are usually difficult to heal, while applying exogenous electrical stimulation to enhance the endogenous electric field in the wound has been proven to significantly accelerate wound healing. However, traditional electrical stimulation devices require an additional external power supply, making them poor in portability and comfort. In this work, a self-powered piezoelectric poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA)/polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite hydrogel is constructed by establishing a distinctive preparation process of freezing/thawing-solvent replacement-annealing-swelling. The hydrogen bonding in the hydrogel is remarkably enhanced by the annealing-swelling process, which is stronger between PVA/PVDF molecules than that between PVA molecules, promoting transformation of the α-phase into the electroactive β-phase PVDF and facilitating formation of a much more crystalline structure with high cross-linking density. Hence, an obvious piezoelectric response with high piezoelectric coefficient and electrical signal output with superior stability and sensitivity and excellent mechanical strength and stretchability was achieved for hydrogels. PVA/PVDF composite hydrogels with good cytocompatibility significantly promote proliferation, migration, and secretion of extracellular matrix proteins and growth factors of fibroblasts, possibly through activating the AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. In a wound model of diabetic rats, piezoelectric hydrogels could not only rapidly attract wound exudate and maintain the wet environment of the wound bed but also convert the mechanical energy generated by rats' physical activities into electrical energy, so as to provide local piezoelectric stimulation to the wound bed evenly and symmetrically in real time. Such an effect significantly promotes re-epithelialization and collagen deposition and increases angiogenesis and secretion of growth factors in wound tissue. Besides, it regulates the macrophage phenotype from the M1 subtype (pro-inflammatory subtype) to the M2 subtype (anti-inflammatory subtype) and reduces the expression levels of inflammatory factors, thus accelerating wound healing. The development of such a novel piezoelectric hydrogel provides new therapeutic strategies for chronic wound healing.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2022,Oct
A robust carbon dot-based antibacterial CDs-PVA film as a wound dressing for antibiosis and wound healing.,"Developing highly effective antibacterial films to promote wound healing remains a huge challenge. Herein, homogeneous and self-standing CDs-PVA composite films (PVA<sub>3</sub>, PVA<sub>5</sub> and PVA<sub>8</sub>) were constructed by doping various mass ratios (3, 5 and 8 wt%) of carbon dots (CDs) into polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), which had no cracks or macroscopic defects. Moreover, the robust mechanical strength and flexibility enabled them to be cut into diverse patterns as required, which provided unique advantages for being employed as a wound dressing. PVA<sub>5</sub> and PVA<sub>8</sub> were powerful broad-spectrum bactericides and they could kill both Gram-negative bacteria and Gram-positive bacteria like <i>Escherichia coli</i> (<i>E. coli</i>) and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (<i>S. aureus</i>) with the antibacterial efficacy over 90.0%. More significantly, the biocompatible films could be readily processed into a ""band-aid"" type dressing for wound healing. The PVA<sub>5</sub> band-aids were just pasted on the wounds for two days and then removed, and the wounds were completely closed after fourteen days. Neither introducing any metals or antibiotics, nor with the help of any external activation, these kinds of CD-based films have the strengths of low cost, being easy to use, excellent biocompatibility and outstanding antibacterial performance, and are desirable wound dressings for various skin injuries.",Journal of materials chemistry.

Topically Applied Biopolymer-Based Tri-Layered Hierarchically Structured Nanofibrous Scaffold with a Self-Pumping Effect for Accelerated Full-Thickness Wound Healing in a Rat Model.,"Wound healing has grown to be a significant problem at a global scale. The lack of multifunctionality in most wound dressing-based biopolymers prevents them from meeting all clinical requirements. Therefore, a multifunctional biopolymer-based tri-layered hierarchically nanofibrous scaffold in wound dressing can contribute to skin regeneration. In this study, a multifunctional antibacterial biopolymer-based tri-layered hierarchically nanofibrous scaffold comprising three layers was constructed. The bottom and the top layers contain hydrophilic silk fibroin (SF) and fish skin collagen (COL), respectively, for accelerated healing, interspersed with a middle layer of hydrophobic poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) containing amoxicillin (AMX) as an antibacterial drug. The advantageous physicochemical properties of the nanofibrous scaffold were estimated by SEM, FTIR, fluid uptake, contact angle, porosity, and mechanical properties. Moreover, the in vitro cytotoxicity and cell healing were assessed by MTT assay and the cell scratching method, respectively, and revealed excellent biocompatibility. The nanofibrous scaffold exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against multiple pathogenic bacteria. Furthermore, the in vivo wound healing and histological studies demonstrated complete wound healing in wounded rats on day 14, along with an increase in the expression level of the transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) and a decrease in the expression level of interleukin-6 (IL-6). The results revealed that the fabricated nanofibrous scaffold is a potent wound dressing scaffold, and significantly accelerates full-thickness wound healing in a rat model.",Pharmaceutics,eng,2023,May
Effect of scaffold architecture and BMP-2/BMP-7 delivery on in vitro bone regeneration.,"The aim of this study was to develop 3-D tissue engineered constructs that mimic the in vivo conditions through a self-contained growth factor delivery system. A set of nanoparticles providing the release of BMP-2 initially followed by the release of BMP-7 were incorporated in poly(ε-caprolactone) scaffolds with different 3-D architectures produced by 3-D plotting and wet spinning. The release patterns were: each growth factor alone, simultaneous, and sequential. The orientation of the fibers did not have a significant effect on the kinetics of release of the model protein BSA; but affected proliferation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. Cell proliferation on random scaffolds was significantly higher compared to the oriented ones. Delivery of BMP-2 alone suppressed MSC proliferation and increased the ALP activity to a higher level than that with BMP-7 delivery. Proliferation rate was suppressed the most by the sequential delivery of the two growth factors from the random scaffold on which the ALP activity was the highest. Results indicated the distinct effect of scaffold architecture and the mode of growth factor delivery on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of MSCs, enabling us to design multifunctional scaffolds capable of controlling bone healing.",Journal of materials science.

Self-assembling peptide and nHA/CTS composite scaffolds promote bone regeneration through increasing seed cell adhesion.,"Porous scaffolds fabricated with nano-hydroxyapatite (nHA) and chitosan (CTS), are widely used in bone tissue engineering (BTE). However, cell adhesion is relatively poor in nHA/CTS scaffolds, which also do not provide an ideal three-dimensional environment for seed cells. These deficiencies limit the applicability of these BTE scaffolds to repair bone defects. To address these challenges, we designed a composite scaffold that combines nHA/CTS with self-assembling peptide (SAP), a material which is similar to the extracellular matrix. We found that SAP/nHA/CTS scaffolds both increased the adhesion of bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and enhanced the mechanical properties of the scaffold. This composite scaffold was then used to repair a femoral condylar bone defect in a mouse model. Healing and mineralization was demonstrated after 12 weeks using H&E staining, microcomputerized tomography, and bone mineral density tests. To our knowledge, this is the first report that SAP/nHA/CTS scaffolds can increase cell adhesion and promote the reconstruction of femoral condylar bone defects. Moreover, this study indicates that BTE using a SAP/nHA/CTS scaffold may be a novel prospective strategy for healing extensive bone defects.","Materials science & engineering.

Cytosine-Functionalized Supramolecular Polymer-Mediated Cellular Behavior and Wound Healing.,"Physically cross-linked supramolecular polymers composed of a hydrophobic poly(epichlorohydrin) backbone with hydrogen-bonding cytosine pendant groups and hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) side chains spontaneously self-assemble to form highly controlled, reversible supramolecular polymer networks (SPNs) because of cytosine-induced transient cross-linking. Owing to their simple synthesis procedure and ease of tuning the cytosine and PEG contents to obtain varying degrees of SPNs within the polymer matrix, the resulting polymers exhibit a unique surface morphology, wide-range tunable mechanical/rheological properties, and surface wettability behavior as well as high biocompatibility and structural stability in normal cell- and red blood cell-rich media. Cell culture experiments and fluorescent images clearly demonstrated that the incorporation of cytosine and PEG units into the SPN-based polymer substrates efficiently promoted cellular attachment and accelerated cell growth. Importantly, scratch wound-healing assays revealed that the cytosine-functionalized substrates promoted rapid cell spreading and migration into the damaged cellular surface and accelerated the wound-healing rate. These results indicate that the presence of cytosine units within polymer substrates is crucial for the construction of multifunctional tissue engineering scaffolds with tailorable physical characteristics in order to promote cell adhesion, proliferation, and differentiation.",Biomacromolecules,eng,2020,Sep
"Clear corneal incision, an important step in modern cataract surgery: a review.","A clear corneal incision (CCI) is the most commonly used entrance site in modern phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Despite some initial concerns about increased endophthalmitis rates through a self-sealing CCI, recent literature suggests that the risk of infection with proper wound construction and all other necessary precautions is minimal. The technique of creating a clear corneal incision has, with recent developments in corneal imaging, undergone critical appraisal leading to a better understanding of incision architecture. Many surgeons operate through smaller incisions, and they have a wide choice of surgical instruments to create their corneal incisions. The aim of this review is to discuss the history and the current status of clear corneal incision creation, the design and materials of surgical blades, and the current trends in manufacturing and sustainability. Although disposable instruments have some advantages and are very popular, recycling, if possible, and avoiding unnecessary plastic waste are important considerations. In any case, the step of CCI is a small one for the surgeon, but a big one for the eye. That is why it has to be done with the utmost precision and in-depth knowledge is important.","Eye (London, England)",eng,2023,Oct
Aligned electrospun fiber film loaded with multi-enzyme mimetic iridium nanozymes for wound healing.,"A film with elaborate microstructures that offers biomimetic properties and multi functionalities is highly desired in wound healing. Here, we develop an aligned hydrogel fiber film integrated with multi-active constituents to promote wound healing. Such fiber films are designed and constructed by photo-crosslinking the methacrylate gelatin (GelMA) doped with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) and iridium nanoparticles coated with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP-Ir NPs) in the precursor solution using electrospinning. The nature of GelMA hydrogel and the aligned arrangement of nanofibers endow the film with high-water content, self-degradability, improved bionic characteristics, oriented cell growth, and improved cell proliferation and migration. Moreover, the encapsulated nanozymes and Ag NPs offer the fiber film with superior reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging and antibacterial capability. The infected wound model shows that the multi-active hydrogel fiber film can reduce inflammation by killing bacteria and decomposing ROS, which accelerates the growth of new blood vessels and granulation tissue. Benefitting from these features, the versatile aligned GelMA fiber film demonstrates the clinically translational potential for wound healing.",Journal of nanobiotechnology,eng,2022,Nov
A multifunctional supercapacitor based on 2D nanosheets on a flexible carbon nanotube film.,"The manufacture of multifunctional and high-performance wearable supercapacitors (SCs) requires a new class of flexible electrodes with high conductivity, high mechanical stability, good water-proof ability and self-healable capability. Herein, we report a stretchable and self-healable SC based on a MoS2/PEDOT/CNT electrode. The specific capacitance of the SC could be retained up to 81.98% even after the 21st breaking/healing cycle. Furthermore, a sheet-type asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) based on a MoS2/PEDOT/CNT positive electrode and SnS2/CNT negative electrode is constructed, and it exhibits high performance with an extended potential window of 1.7 V, areal capacitance of 103.76 mF cm-2 at 1.5 mA cm-2, and outstanding stability with no capacitance degradation under a wide range of bending conditions. The ASC is sealed by polyimide films, and it shows high electrochemical stability in hot water and under high speed centrifugation conditions, indicating good water-proof ability and wearability. The as-prepared ASC is also encapsulated in elastic films to provide 225% stretchability. The ASC devices packaged in all these ways exhibit high capacitance retention (>90%) under various bending and dynamic conditions.","Dalton transactions (Cambridge, England : 2003)",eng,2020,Jul
Layer-by-Layer Microneedle-Mediated rhEGF Transdermal Delivery for Enhanced Wound Epidermal Regeneration and Angiogenesis.,"Appropriate treatments for acute traumas tend to avoid hemorrhages, vascular damage, and infections. However, in the homeostasis-imbalanced wound microenvironment, currently developed therapies could not precisely and controllably deliver biomacromolecular drugs, which are confronted with challenges due to large molecular weight, poor biomembrane permeability, low dosage, rapid degradation, and bioactivity loss. To conquer this, we construct a simple and effective layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly transdermal delivery patch, bearing microneedles (MN) coated with recombinant human epidermal growth factor (LBL MN-rhEGF) for a sustained release to wound bed driven by typical electrostatic force. Pyramidal LBL MN-rhEGF patches hold so enough mechanical strength to penetrate the stratum corneum, and generated microchannels allow rhEGF direct delivery in situ. The administrable delivery of biomacromolecular rhEGF through hierarchically coated MN arrays follows the diffusion mechanism of Fick's second law. Numerous efforts further have illustrated that finger-pressing LBL MN-rhEGF patches could not only promote cell proliferation of normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) <i>in vitro</i> but also take significant effects (regenerative epidermis: ∼144 μm; pro-angiogenesis: higher CD31 expression) in accelerating wound healing of mechanically injured rats, compared to the traditional dressing, which relies on passive diffusion. Our proof-of-concept features novel LBL biomacromolecular drug-delivery systems and self-administrated precision medicine modes at the point of care.",ACS applied materials & interfaces,eng,2023,May
Designer Dual Therapy Nanolayered Implant Coatings Eradicate Biofilms and Accelerate Bone Tissue Repair.,"Infections associated with orthopedic implants cause increased morbidity and significant healthcare cost. A prolonged and expensive two-stage procedure requiring two surgical steps and a 6-8 week period of joint immobilization exists as today's gold standard for the revision arthroplasty of an infected prosthesis. Because infection is much more common in implant replacement surgeries, these issues greatly impact long-term patient care for a continually growing part of the population. Here, we demonstrate that a single-stage revision using prostheses coated with self-assembled, hydrolytically degradable multilayers that sequentially deliver the antibiotic (gentamicin) and the osteoinductive growth factor (BMP-2) in a time-staggered manner enables both eradication of established biofilms and complete and rapid bone tissue repair around the implant in rats with induced osteomyelitis. The nanolayered construct allows precise independent control of release kinetics and loading for each therapeutic agent in an infected implant environment. Antibiotics contained in top layers can be tuned to provide a rapid release at early times sufficient to eliminate infection, followed by sustained release for several weeks, and the underlying BMP-2 component enables a long-term sustained release of BMP-2, which induced more significant and mechanically competent bone formation than a short-term burst release. The successful growth factor-mediated osteointegration of the multilayered implants with the host tissue improved bone-implant interfacial strength 15-fold when compared with the uncoated one. These findings demonstrate the potential of this layered release strategy to introduce a durable next-generation implant solution, ultimately an important step forward to future large animal models toward the clinic.",ACS nano,eng,2016,Apr

Multifunctional hemostatic polysaccharide-based sponge enhanced by tunicate cellulose: A promising approach for photothermal antibacterial activity and accelerated wound healing.,"Fast and effective hemostasis and protection against wound infection play a crucial role in trauma care. In this study, a sponge scaffold with a self-expanding interpenetrating macropore structure was designed via two-step cross-linking method for hemostasis and photothermal antimicrobial activity. Oxidized Konjac glucomannan (OKGM) and chitosan (CS) were crosslinked once to form a dynamic covalent bonding network, and a basic three-dimensional fiber porous network framework was constructed by uniformly dispersing Tunicate nanocellulose (TCNCs). Secondary crosslinking introduced Polydopamine (PDA NPs) into the sponge, while dynamic hydrogen bonds were interleaved to stabilize the frame. PDA NPs enhanced the sponge's antibacterial and antioxidant properties due to its good photothermal conversion efficiency and oxygen radical scavenging ability. Compared to cotton gauze and gelatin sponges, the composite sponges showed superior blood cell adhesion and platelet activation. In tests on rat liver trauma models, composite sponges showed shorter hemostasis time (12 ± 2.17 s) and less blood loss (0.1 ± 0.052 g). Sponges can protect wound tissue through their adhesion properties. In the full-thickness wound model infected with S. aureus, the composite sponge accelerated wound healing. Overall, this composite sponge has great potential for clinical use as a wound dressing.",International journal of biological macromolecules,eng,2023,Aug
Methacrylated Cartilage ECM-Based Hydrogels as Injectables and Bioinks for Cartilage Tissue Engineering.,"Articular cartilage (AC) possesses a limited healing potential, meaning that untreated focal joint defects typically progress, leading to the development of degenerative diseases such as osteoarthritis. Several clinical strategies exist that aim to regenerate AC; however, recapitulation of a fully functional, load-bearing tissue remains a significant challenge. This can be attributed, at least in part, to a paucity of biomaterials that truly mimic the native tissue and provide appropriate cues to direct its regeneration. The main structural component of articular cartilage, type II collagen, does not readily gelate at body temperature, challenging the development of cartilage extracellular matrix (cECM)-derived injectable hydrogels and bioinks for AC tissue engineering and bioprinting applications. Here, we describe the development and rheological characterisation of a methacrylated cartilage ECM-based hydrogel/bioink (cECM-MA), which could be photocrosslinked when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Functionalisation of the collagen backbone with methacryloyl groups had a negligible effect on triple helix stability, as demonstrated by circular dichroism spectroscopy. These cECM-MA bioinks demonstrated shear-thinning properties and could be loaded with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs), micro-extruded to generate self-supporting 3D constructs of predefined size and shape, and then photocrosslinked using UV light. Analysis of the cell-laden constructs showed that the BM-MSCs were viable post-printing and underwent chondrogenesis in vitro, generating a tissue rich in sulphated glycosaminoglycans and collagens. These results support the use of methacrylated, tissue-specific ECM-derived hydrogels as bioinks for 3D bioprinting and/or as injectables for cartilage tissue engineering applications.",Biomolecules,eng,2022,Jan
Compressive and Tensile Elastic Properties of Concrete: Empirical Factors in Span Reinforced Structures Design.,"Concretes with the same strength can have various deformability that influences span structures deflection. In addition, a significant factor is the non-linear deformation of concrete dependence on the load. The main deformability parameter of concrete is the instantaneous modulus of elasticity. This research aims to evaluate the relation of concrete compressive and tensile elastic properties testing. The beam samples at 80 × 140 × 1400 cm with one rod Ø8 composite or Ø10 steel reinforcement were experimentally tested. It was shown that instantaneous elastic deformations under compression are much lower than tensile. Prolonged elastic deformations under compression are close to tensile. It results in compressive elasticity modulus exceeding the tensile. The relation between these moduli is proposed. The relation provides operative elasticity modulus testing by the bending tensile method. The elasticity modulus's evaluation for the reinforced span structures could be based only on the bending testing results. A 10% elasticity modulus increase, which seems not significant, increases at 30-40% the stress of the reinforced span structures under load and 30% increases the cracking point stress.","Materials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2021,Dec
Clindamycin-loaded titanium prevents implant-related infection through blocking biofilm formation.,"Implant-related infection is a disastrous complication. Surface modification of titanium is considered as an important strategy to prevent implant-related infection. However, there is no recognized surface modification strategy that can be applied in clinic so far. We explored a new strategy of coating. The clindamycin-loaded titanium was constructed by layer-by-layer self-assembly. The release of clindamycin from titanium was detected through high performance liquid chromatography. Different titanium was co-cultured with <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> for 24 h in vitro, then the effect of different titanium on bacterial colonization and biofilm formation was determined by spread plate method and scanning electron microscopy. Cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility of clindamycin-loaded titanium on MC3T3-E1 cells were measured by CCK8. The antibacterial ability of clindamycin-loaded titanium in vivo was also evaluated using a rat model of osteomyelitis. The number of osteoclasts in bone defect was observed by tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase staining. Bacterial burden of surrounding tissues around the site of infection was calculated by tissue homogenate and colony count. Clindamycin-loaded titanium could release clindamycin slowly within 160 h. It reduced bacterial colonization by three orders of magnitude compare to control (<i>p</i> < .05) and inhibits biofilm formation in vitro. Cells proliferation and adhesion were similar on three titanium surfaces (<i>p</i> > .05). In vivo, clindamycin-loaded titanium improved bone healing, reduced microbial burden, and decreased the number of osteoclasts compared control titanium in the rat model of osteomyelitis. This study demonstrated that clindamycin-loaded titanium exhibited good biocompatibility, and showed antibacterial activity both in vivo and in vitro. It is promising and might have potential for clinical application.",Journal of biomaterials applications,eng,2022,Feb
Accelerated Skin Wound Healing Using Flexible Photovoltaic-Bioelectrode Electrical Stimulation.,"Owing to the complex and long-term treatment of foot wounds due to diabetes and the limited mobility of patients, advanced clinical surgery often uses wearable flexible devices for auxiliary treatment. Therefore, there is an urgent need for self-powered biomedical devices to reduce the extra weight. We have prepared an electrically stimulated MEMS (Micro Electromechanical System) electrode integrated with wearable OPV (Organic photovoltaic). The wearable OPV is constructed of a bio-affinity PET-ITO substrate and a hundred-nanometer organic layer. Under sunlight and near-infrared light irradiation, a voltage and current are supplied to the MEMS electrode to generate an exogenous lateral electric field directed to the center of the wound.

Data of a stiffness softening mechanism effect on proliferation and differentiation of a human bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell line towards the chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages.,"This article contains data related to the research article entitled ""Stiffness memory of indirectly 3D-printed elastomer nanohybrid regulates chondrogenesis and osteogenesis of human mesenchymal stem cells"" [1] (Wu et al., 2018). Cells respond to the local microenvironment in a context dependent fashion and a continuous challenge is to provide a living construct that can adapt to the viscoelasticity changes of surrounding tissues. Several materials are attractive candidates to be used in tissue engineering, but conventional manufactured scaffolds are primarily static models with well-defined and stable stiffness that lack the dynamic biological nature required to undergo changes in substrate elasticity decisive in several cellular processes key during tissue development and wound healing. A family of poly (urea-urethane) (PUU) elastomeric nanohybrid scaffolds (PUU-POSS) with thermoresponsive mechanical properties that soften by reverse self-assembling at body temperature had been developed through a 3D thermal induced phase transition process (3D-TIPS) at various thermal conditions: cryo-coagulation (CC), cryo-coagulation and heating (CC + H) and room temperature coagulation and heating (RTC + H). The stiffness relaxation and stiffness softening of these scaffolds suggest regulatory effects in proliferation and differentiation of human bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBM-MSCs) towards the chondrogenic and osteogenic lineages.",Data in brief,eng,2018,Dec

Degradable Temperature-Sensitive Hydrogel Loaded with Heparin Effectively Prevents Post-Operative Tissue Adhesions.,"Tissue adhesions could occur following surgeries, and severe tissue adhesions can lead to serious complications. Medical hydrogels could be applied at surgical sites as a physical barrier to prevent tissue adhesion. For practical reasons, spreadable, degradable, and self-healable gels are highly demanded. To meet these requirements, we applied carboxymethyl chitosan (CMCS) to poloxamer-based hydrogels to generate low Poloxamer<sub>338</sub> (P<sub>338</sub>) content gels displaying low viscosity at refrigerator temperature and improved mechanical strength at body temperature. Heparin, an effective adhesion inhibitor, was also added to construct P<sub>338</sub>/CMCS-heparin composite hydrogel (PCHgel). PCHgel presents as a flowable liquid below 20 °C and could rapidly transform into gel when spread on the surface of damaged tissue due to temperature change. The introduction of CMCS enabled hydrogels to form a stable self-healable barrier at injured positions and slowly release heparin during the wound healing period before being degraded after ∼14 days. Ultimately, PCHgel significantly reduced tissue adhesion in model rats and displayed higher efficiency than P<sub>338</sub>/CMCS gel without heparin. Its adhesion suppression mechanism was verified, and it also displayed good biosafety. Therefore, PCHgel showed good clinical transformation potential with high efficacy, good safety, and ease of use.",ACS biomaterials science & engineering,eng,2023,Jun
Construction of Wogonin Nanoparticle-Containing Strontium-Doped Nanoporous Structure on Titanium Surface to Promote Osteoporosis Fracture Repair.,"M2 polarization of macrophage is an important immunomodulatory event that attenuates inflammation. To regulate the immune microenvironment in osteoporotic conditions for enhancing bone healing, strontium-doped nano-structure is fabricated on the surface of titanium implant via microarc oxidation and electrochemical deposition technology, followed by the addition of multiplayer coatings embedded with silk fibroin-based wogonin nanoparticles (Ti-MAO/Sr/LBL<sub>WNP</sub> ) by layer-by-layer self-assembly technique (LBL). It is found that Ti-MAO/Sr/LBL<sub>WNP</sub> can release wogonin and Sr<sup>2+</sup> in a sustainable manner for more than 7 and 21 days. In vitro studies show that Ti-MAO/Sr/LBL<sub>WNP</sub> significantly upregulates the expression of CD206 while reducing the expression of CD86. Meanwhile, Ti-MAO/Sr/LBL<sub>WNP</sub> can promote the expression level of M2 macrophage anti-inflammatory factor (TGF-β1, Arg-1), which improves the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of osteoblasts through paracrine signaling. Compared to bare titanium, Ti-MAO/Sr/LBL<sub>WNP</sub> significantly inhibits the expression of inflammatory factors around the implant and effectively promotes new bone formation at pre-implant interface after implantation for 4 weeks.

[Lino Castle - An interior design concept to improve inpatient treatment in child and adolescent psychiatry].,"Lino Castle - An interior design concept to improve inpatient treatment in child and adolescent psychiatry Abstract. Only very few data exist concerning hospital architecture in psychiatry/child and adolescent psychiatry. Previous data suggest that architectural improvements do reduce the application of coercive measures as well as reducing aggressive behavior, endangerment of self and others, and provoking changes in the kind and frequency of medication. In order to improve the overall hospital environment of inpatient treatment, the Center for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of Clienia Littenheid AG developed a spatial and communication concept named ""Lino Castle."" In cooperation with patients, their parents as well as members of the multidisciplinary team, we implemented a concept that serves to ameliorate the recovery process of the children and adolescents. ""Lino Castle"" is deeply rooted in the history of the local village and aims to allow patients to feel at ease for the duration of their stay. It hosts seven characters that serve as guardians and protectors of the individual wards and represent various types of disorders and emotional states. The respective architectural concept grew out of the storyline of ""Lino Castle"" and combines colors, forms, materials, graphics, and furniture to ensure an environment conducive to healing and reduced anxiety. With the implementation of ""Lino Castle,"" we observed that the number of admissions and hospital occupancy increased significantly, whereas the length of stay and the ratio of involuntary admissions in closed wards decreased. We presume that this turn of events is due to higher commitment, acceptance, and less aggressive behavior in the patients, and to higher motivation and work satisfaction in the staff.",Zeitschrift fur Kinder- und Jugendpsychiatrie und Psychotherapie,ger,2019,Jan
Animal models for cartilage repair.,"Cartilage lesions still represent an unsolved problem: despite the efforts of the basic and translational research, the regeneration of this tissue is far from being reached (1-3). Articular cartilage lesions can be divided in two main groups: superficial or partial defects and full-thickness defects (4, 5). Partial lesions are not able to self-heal because multipotent cells from the bone marrow cannot reach the area leading to a progressive degeneration of the tissue (6). Conversely, full-thickness injuries possess greater chances to heal because subchondral bone involvement allows for the migration of mesenchymal cells, which fill the damaged area (7, 8). However, healing occurs through the formation of a fibrocartilaginous tissue, which has different biomechanical and biological properties (9). Native hyaline cartilage has indeed specific biomechanical properties, which confer resistance to compressive and shear stresses; the reparative fibrocartilaginous tissue lacks these abilities, therefore, the surrounding healthy cartilage progressively degenerates. In the past years, several therapeutic strategies have been developed to restore the damaged cartilage, bone marrow stimulation (chondroabrasion, drilling, micro- or nano-fractures) and more recently, tissue engineering approaches (10-14). Some of these latter procedures have already been applied in clinical practice such as matrix-induced autologous chondrocyte implantation (MACI) (15) or osteochondral scaffold implantation (16). Generally, tissue engineering approaches are based on the combination of three main elements: cells (i.e. primary chondrocytes or multipotent mesenchymal cells), biocompatible scaffolds (i.e. polymers, composites, ceramics) and signaling molecules (i.e. growth factors). Moreover, several culture conditions (i.e. static or dynamic cultures) and biomechanical stimuli can be applied during the <i>in vitro</i> culture to promote tissue maturation (17-19). However, an <i>in vivo</i> culture is mandatory to validate a new engineered construct as the <i>in vitro</i> phase lacks the essential <i>in vivo</i> environmental stimuli and because the <i>in vivo</i> culture allows for the testing of the biocompatibility and safety of a new material (18, 19). Moreover, preclinical animal models are crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms of cartilage lesions favoring the development of new regenerative strategies (20, 21). <i>in vivo</i> studies on animal models should focus on the analysis of the cellular component, analyzing the maintenance of the cellular phenotype and the tumorigenicity; on the evaluation of the biocompatibility, toxicity and degradation of the biomaterial and on the assessment of the engineered construct. In this manuscript, we will review the most common preclinical animal models, which are used to understand cartilage biology and therefore to develop new tissue engineering strategies. We will focus on both small and large animal models highlighting their peculiarities, advantages and drawbacks.",Journal of biological regulators and homeostatic agents,eng,2018,No Data
"Type I collagen decorated nanoporous network on titanium implant surface promotes osseointegration through mediating immunomodulation, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis.","Osseointegration of implants is a complex physiological process that requires temporal and spatial regulation of immune responses, angiogenesis, and osteogenesis. To achieve efficient and long-term osseointegration, type I collagen (COL1) decorated nanoporous network was developed on titanium substrates via alkali treatment, polydopamine coating, and layer-by-layer (LBL) self-assembly. It was noted that the simple physisorbed COL1 could be easily desorbed from the nanostructured surface, however, multilayer COL1 constructed by polydopamine and LBL self-assembly obscured the nanoporous network of the alkali-treated titanium surfaces. Interestingly, the nanostructured surface covalently immobilized with COL1 (T-ADC) could timely convert macrophages (MΦs) from pro-inflammatory M1 to pro-healing M2 phenotype, generating a beneficial osteoimmune microenvironment and promoting angio/osteo-genesis. RNA sequencing revealed that the nanostructure and COL1 could synergistically activate RhoA/ROCK, PI3K-AKT, and classical MAPK signaling pathways in MΦs to sustain the cell cycle, and trigger autocrine feedback-mediated JAK-STAT and FoxO signaling pathways, which in turn motivated autophagy and oxidative stress resistance and attenuated lipopolysaccharide-induced Toll-like receptor signaling pathway and its downstream NF-κB and JNK/p38 MAPK signaling cascades, leading to the inhibition of inflammation and osteoclastic-related gene expression of MΦs. Simultaneously, T-ADC prominently facilitated angiogenesis of endothelial cells and osteogenesis of osteoblasts as well as their cross-talks, further highlighting synergistically positive effects of the nanostructure and COL1 on osseointegration. In vivo experiments revealed that T-ADC could induce abundant new bone mass and ameliorative osseointegration, corroborating the in vitro results. The study elucidated that the COL1 decorated nanoporous network on titanium surfaces could significantly regulate early inflammatory reaction and subsequent angio/osteo-genesis processes, resulting in favorable osseointegration.",Biomaterials,eng,2022,Sep
Derma-like antibacterial polysaccharide gel dressings for wound care.,"Large skin wound infections have high morbidity, which threaten the health of human beings severely. It is essential to develop new wound dressings that can block microbial invasion, eliminate bacteria effectively, adhere to wounds firmly, and have good biocompatibility. In this work, we designed a kind of polysaccharide gel (DLG) dressings with derma-like structure that had good wound care performances. With a facile penetration cross-linking method by the Schiff base reaction between oxidized hyaluronic acid solution and carboxymethyl chitosan solution with higher viscosity, a gradient porous structure was formed inside DLG to mimic the structure of derma, which was due to the simultaneous penetration and reaction processes between two viscous solutions. This derma-like structure endowed the gel dressings with the abilities of self-adhesion to wounds and barriers against bacteria. Through the introduction of cuttlefish juice and gentamycin, the modified gel dressings (DLG-GS) showed mild photothermal effects under the near infrared irradiation at the wavelength of 808 nm, which could reach and maintain the temperature of 45 °C. The mild heat could act together with gentamycin to produce a rapid bactericidal performance within 5 min. Meanwhile, the polysaccharide gel dressings had good biocompatibility. The in vivo anti-infection properties of DLG-GS was demonstrated by an animal model of infected full-thickness skin defect. This strategy provided a feasible solution for the prevention and treatment of infected large wounds. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Derma-like antibacterial gel dressings (DLG-GS) with high bacterial barrier ability, strong tissue adhesive property and good biocompatibility were constructed by a penetration cross-linking method. DLG-GS could eliminate bacterial infection within 5 min due to the rational combination of a mild photothermal effect and antibiotics. DLG-GS showed high anti-infection and wound healing properties in an animal model of infected full-thickness skin defect. This study provides a flexible and universal strategy for the development  of antibacterial wound dressings.",Acta biomaterialia,eng,2022,Aug
In vitro and in vivo investigation of osteogenic properties of self-contained phosphate-releasing injectable purine-crosslinked chitosan-hydroxyapatite constructs.,"Bone fracture repair is a multifaceted, coordinated physiological process that requires new bone formation and resorption, eventually returning the fractured bone to its original state. Currently, a variety of different approaches are pursued to accelerate the repair of defective bones, which include the use of 'gold standard' autologous bone grafts. However, such grafts may not be readily available, and procedural complications may result in undesired outcomes. Considering the ease of use and tremendous customization potentials, synthetic materials may become a more suitable alternative of bone grafts. In this study, we examined the osteogenic potential of guanosine 5'-diphosphate-crosslinked chitosan scaffolds with the incorporation of hydroxyapatite, with or without pyrophosphatase activity, both in vitro and in vivo. First, scaffolds embedded with cells were characterized for cell morphology, viability, and attachment. The cell-laden scaffolds were found to significantly enhance proliferation for up to threefold, double alkaline phosphatase activity and osterix expression, and increase calcium phosphate deposits in vitro. Next, chitosan scaffolds were implanted at the fracture site in a mouse model of intramedullary rod-fixed tibial fracture. Our results showed increased callus formation at the fracture site with the scaffold carrying both hydroxyapatite and pyrophosphatase in comparison to the control scaffolds lacking both pyrophosphatase and hydroxyapatite, or pyrophosphatase alone. These results indicate that the pyrophosphatase-hydroxyapatite composite scaffold has a promising capacity to facilitate bone fracture healing.",Scientific reports,eng,2020,Jul
Nerve guides manufactured from photocurable polymers to aid peripheral nerve repair.,"The peripheral nervous system has a limited innate capacity for self-repair following injury, and surgical intervention is often required. For injuries greater than a few millimeters autografting is standard practice although it is associated with donor site morbidity and is limited in its availability. Because of this, nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) can be viewed as an advantageous alternative, but currently have limited efficacy for short and large injury gaps in comparison to autograft. Current commercially available NGC designs rely on existing regulatory approved materials and traditional production methods, limiting improvement of their design. The aim of this study was to establish a novel method for NGC manufacture using a custom built laser-based microstereolithography (μSL) setup that incorporated a 405 nm laser source to produce 3D constructs with ∼ 50 μm resolution from a photocurable poly(ethylene glycol) resin. These were evaluated by SEM, in vitro neuronal, Schwann and dorsal root ganglion culture and in vivo using a thy-1-YFP-H mouse common fibular nerve injury model. NGCs with dimensions of 1 mm internal diameter × 5 mm length with a wall thickness of 250 μm were fabricated and capable of supporting re-innervation across a 3 mm injury gap after 21 days, with results close to that of an autograft control. The study provides a technology platform for the rapid microfabrication of biocompatible materials, a novel method for in vivo evaluation, and a benchmark for future development in more advanced NGC designs, biodegradable and larger device sizes, and longer-term implantation studies.",Biomaterials,eng,2015,May
Combinatory approach for developing silk fibroin scaffolds for cartilage regeneration.,"Several processing technologies and engineering strategies have been combined to create scaffolds with superior performance for efficient tissue regeneration. Cartilage tissue is a good example of that, presenting limited self-healing capacity together with a high elasticity and load-bearing properties. In this work, novel porous silk fibroin (SF) scaffolds derived from horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-mediated crosslinking of highly concentrated aqueous SF solution (16 wt%) in combination with salt-leaching and freeze-drying methodologies were developed for articular cartilage tissue engineering (TE) applications. The HRP-crosslinked SF scaffolds presented high porosity (89.3 ± 0.6%), wide pore distribution and high interconnectivity (95.9 ± 0.8%). Moreover, a large swelling capacity and favorable degradation rate were observed up to 30 days, maintaining the porous-like structure and β-sheet conformational integrity obtained with salt-leaching and freeze-drying processing. The in vitro studies supported human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) adhesion, proliferation, and high glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) synthesis under chondrogenic culture conditions. Furthermore, the chondrogenic differentiation of hASCs was assessed by the expression of chondrogenic-related markers (collagen type II, Sox-9 and Aggrecan) and deposition of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix for up to 28 days. The cartilage engineered constructs also presented structural integrity as their mechanical properties were improved after chondrogenic culturing. Subcutaneous implantation of the scaffolds in CD-1 mice demonstrated no necrosis or calcification, and deeply tissue ingrowth. Collectively, the structural properties and biological performance of these porous HRP-crosslinked SF scaffolds make them promising candidates for cartilage regeneration.",Acta biomaterialia,eng,2018,May
Polymeric micelles loading with ursolic acid enhancing anti-tumor effect on hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Ursolic acid (UA) is widely found in many dietary plants, which has been proved to be effective in cancer therapy. But unfortunately its hydrophobic property limits its clinical application. Polymer micelles (PMs) are constructed from amphiphilic block copolymers that tend to self-assemble and form the unique core-shell structure consisting of a hydrophilic corona outside and a hydrophobic inner core. PMs could entrap the hydrophobic substance into its hydrophobic inner core for solubilizing these poorly water-soluble drugs and it is widely applied as a novel nano-sized drug delivery system. This study aimed to develop the drug delivery system of UA-loaded polymer micelles (UA-PMs) to overcome the disadvantages of UA in clinical application thus enhancing antitumor effect on hepatocellular carcinoma. UA-PMs was prepared and characterized for the physicochemical properties. It was investigated the cell-growth inhibition effect of UA-PMs against the human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and human normal liver cell line L-02. UA-PMs was evaluated about the <i>in vivo</i> toxicity and the antitumor activity. We took a diblock copolymer of methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-poly(L-lactic acid) (mPEG-PLA) as carrier material to prepare UA-PMs by the thin-film dispersion method. MTT assay and wound-healing assay were investigated to assess the inhibition effect of UA-PMs against HepG2 cells on cell-growth and cell-migration. Further, we chose KM mice for the acute toxicity experiment and assessed the antitumor effect of UA-PMs on the H22 tumor xenograft. UA-PMs could markedly inhibit the proliferation and migration of HepG2 cells. <i>In vivo</i> study showed that UA-PMs could significantly inhibit the growth of H22 xenograft and prolong the survival time of tumor-bearing mice. It demonstrated that UA-PMs possess great potential in liver cancer therapy and may enlarge the application of UA in clinical therapy.",Journal of Cancer,eng,2019,No Data

Near-infrared light-controllable MXene hydrogel for tunable on-demand release of therapeutic proteins.,"Precise delivery of therapeutic protein drugs that specifically modulate desired cellular responses is critical in clinical practice. However, the spatiotemporal regulation of protein drugs release to manipulate the target cell population in vivo remains a huge challenge. Herein, we have rationally developed an injectable and Near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive MXene-hydrogel composed of Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub>, agarose, and protein that enables flexibly and precisely control the release profile of protein drugs to modulate cellular behaviors with high spatiotemporal precision remotely. As a proof-of-concept study, we preloaded hepatic growth factor (HGF) into the MXene@hydrogel (MXene@agarose/HGF) to activate the c-Met-mediated signaling by NIR light. We demonstrated NIR light-instructed cell diffusion, migration, and proliferation at the user-defined localization, further promoting angiogenesis and wound healing in vivo. Our approach's versatility was validated by preloading tumor necrotic factor-α (TNF-α) into the composite hydrogel (MXene@agarose/TNF-α) to promote the pro-apoptotic signaling pathway, achieving the NIR light-induced programmed cell deaths (PCD) of tumor spheroids. Taking advantage of the deep-tissue penetrative NIR light, we could eradicate the deep-seated tumors in a xenograft model exogenously. Therefore, the proposed MXene-hydrogel provides the impetus for developing therapeutic synthetic materials for light-controlled drug release under thick tissue, which will find promising applications in regenerative medicine and tumor therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Current stimuli-responsive hydrogels for therapeutic proteins delivery mainly depend on self-degradation, passive diffusion, or the responsiveness to cues relevant to diseases. However, it remains challenging to spatiotemporally deliver protein-based drugs to manipulate the target cell population in vivo in an ""on-demand"" manner. Therefore, we have rationally constructed an injectable and Near-infrared (NIR) light-responsive composite hydrogel by embedding Ti<sub>3</sub>C<sub>2</sub> MXene and protein drugs within an agarose hydrogel to enable the remote control of protein drugs delivery with high spatiotemporal precision. The NIR light-controlled release of the growth factor or cytokine has been carried out to regulate receptor-mediated cellular behaviors under deep tissue for skin wound healing or cancer therapy. This system will provide the potential for precision medicine through the development of intelligent drug delivery systems.",Acta biomaterialia,eng,2021,Aug
Engineered Nanotechnology: An Effective Therapeutic Platform for the Chronic Cutaneous Wound.,"The healing of chronic wound infections, especially cutaneous wounds, involves a complex cascade of events demanding mutual interaction between immunity and other natural host processes. Wound infections are caused by the consortia of microbial species that keep on proliferating and produce various types of virulence factors that cause the development of chronic infections. The mono- or polymicrobial nature of surface wound infections is best characterized by its ability to form biofilm that renders antimicrobial resistance to commonly administered drugs due to poor biofilm matrix permeability. With an increasing incidence of chronic wound biofilm infections, there is an urgent need for non-conventional antimicrobial approaches, such as developing nanomaterials that have intrinsic antimicrobial-antibiofilm properties modulating the biochemical or biophysical parameters in the wound microenvironment in order to cause disruption and removal of biofilms, such as designing nanomaterials as efficient drug-delivery vehicles carrying antibiotics, bioactive compounds, growth factor antioxidants or stem cells reaching the infection sites and having a distinct mechanism of action in comparison to antibiotics-functionalized nanoparticles (NPs) for better incursion through the biofilm matrix. NPs are thought to act by modulating the microbial colonization and biofilm formation in wounds due to their differential particle size, shape, surface charge and composition through alterations in bacterial cell membrane composition, as well as their conductivity, loss of respiratory activity, generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitrosation of cysteines of proteins, lipid peroxidation, DNA unwinding and modulation of metabolic pathways. For the treatment of chronic wounds, extensive research is ongoing to explore a variety of nanoplatforms, including metallic and nonmetallic NPs, nanofibers and self-accumulating nanocarriers. As the use of the magnetic nanoparticle (MNP)-entrenched pre-designed hydrogel sheet (MPS) is found to enhance wound healing, the bio-nanocomposites consisting of bacterial cellulose and magnetic nanoparticles (magnetite) are now successfully used for the healing of chronic wounds. With the objective of precise targeting, some kinds of ""intelligent"" nanoparticles are constructed to react according to the required environment, which are later incorporated in the dressings, so that the wound can be treated with nano-impregnated dressing material in situ. For the effective healing of skin wounds, high-expressing, transiently modified stem cells, controlled by nano 3D architectures, have been developed to encourage angiogenesis and tissue regeneration. In order to overcome the challenge of time and dose constraints during drug administration, the approach of combinatorial nano therapy is adopted, whereby AI will help to exploit the full potential of nanomedicine to treat chronic wounds.","Nanomaterials (Basel, Switzerland)",eng,2022,Feb
Enzyme-Responsive Polymeric Vesicles for Bacterial-Strain-Selective Delivery of Antimicrobial Agents.,"Antimicrobial resistance poses serious public health concerns and antibiotic misuse/abuse further complicates the situation; thus, it remains a considerable challenge to optimize/improve the usage of currently available drugs. We report a general strategy to construct a bacterial strain-selective delivery system for antibiotics based on responsive polymeric vesicles. In response to enzymes including penicillin G amidase (PGA) and β-lactamase (Bla), which are closely associated with drug-resistant bacterial strains, antibiotic-loaded polymeric vesicles undergo self-immolative structural rearrangement and morphological transitions, leading to sustained release of antibiotics. Enhanced stability, reduced side effects, and bacterial strain-selective drug release were achieved. Considering that Bla is the main cause of bacterial resistance to β-lactam antibiotic drugs, as a further validation, we demonstrate methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)-triggered release of antibiotics from Bla-degradable polymeric vesicles, in vitro inhibition of MRSA growth, and enhanced wound healing in an in vivo murine model.",Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),eng,2016,Jan
An acid-triggered BODIPY-based photosensitizer for enhanced photodynamic antibacterial efficacy.,"Photodynamic inactivation of bacteria has emerged as a promising antibacterial strategy due to its high antibacterial activity and low bacterial resistance. Herein, an acid-triggered photodynamic antibacterial nanoplatform (IBPAAs) was constructed by co-assembly of an acid-triggered photosensitizer BODIPY (I-NBDP) and the POEGMA-<i>b</i>-PDEAEMA block copolymer for enhancing the antibacterial efficacy and biofilm-dissipation capability. IBPAAs could have great biocompatibility and stability by the formation of self-assemblies, and it could be cleaved to release the I-NBDP photosensitizer under a dual-step acidic response due to the protonation of the diethylamino groups on both I-NBDP and the POEGMA-<i>b</i>-PDEAEMA block copolymer. On the one hand, the photoinduced electron transfer (PET) of I-NBDP in IBPAAs under neutral conditions could be attenuated, resulting in an increase of its <sup>1</sup>O<sub>2</sub> yield, effectively improving its photodynamic antibacterial efficacy. On the other hand, the protonation of IBPAAs made it easier to target negatively charged bacterial surfaces, further enhancing its photodynamic antibacterial activity. The antibacterial experiments <i>in vitro</i> showed that the IBPAAs assemblies had great photodynamic antibacterial efficacy and biofilm dissipation capability, and it could effectively relieve bacterial infection of wounds and accelerate wound healing <i>in vivo</i>. Therefore, this acid-triggered strategy is expected to provide a new path for enhanced photodynamic antibacterial therapy.",Biomaterials science,eng,2022,Jul
A design approach for layer-by-layer surface-mediated siRNA delivery.,"The ability to coat scaffolds and wound dressings with therapeutic short interfering RNA (siRNA) holds much potential for applications in wound healing, cancer treatment, and regenerative medicine. Layer-by-layer (LbL) technology is an effective method to formulate polyelectrolyte thin films for local delivery of siRNA; however, the formation and efficacy of LbL coatings as drug delivery systems are highly contingent on the assembly conditions. Here, we investigate the effects of LbL assembly parameters on film composition and consequent siRNA-mediated gene knockdown efficiency in vitro. Films comprising poly(β-amino ester) (PBAE) and siRNA were built on polyglactin 910 (Vicryl) sutures consisting of poly(10% L-lactide, 90% glycolide). A fractional factorial design was employed, varying the following LbL assembly conditions: pH, ionic strength, PBAE concentration, and siRNA concentration. Effects of these parameters on PBAE loading, siRNA loading, their respective weight ratios, and in vitro siRNA-mediated knockdown were elucidated. The parameter effects were leveraged to create a rationally designed set of solution conditions that was predicted to give effective siRNA-mediated knockdown, but not included in any of the original experimental conditions. This level of knockdown with our rationally designed loading conditions (47%) is comparable to previous formulations from our lab while being simpler in construction and requiring fewer film layers, which could save time and cost in manufacturing. This study highlights the importance of LbL solution conditions in the preparation of surface-mediated siRNA delivery systems and presents an adaptable methodology for extending these electrostatically-assembled coatings to the delivery of other therapeutic nucleic acids. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Short interfering RNA (siRNA) therapeutics are powerful tools to silence aberrant gene expression in the diseased state; however, the clinical utility of these therapies relies on effective controlled delivery approaches. Electrostatic self-assembly through the layer-by-layer (LbL) process enables direct siRNA release from surfaces, but this method is highly dependent upon the specific solution conditions used. Here, we use a fractional factorial design to illustrate how these assembly conditions impact composition of siRNA-eluting LbL thin films. We then elucidate how these properties mediate in vitro transfection efficacy. Ultimately, this work presents a significant step towards understanding how optimization of assembly conditions for surface-mediated LbL delivery can promote transfection efficacy while reducing the processing and material required.",Acta biomaterialia,eng,2021,Nov
Nano-elemental selenium particle developed via supramolecular self-assembly of chondroitin sulfate A and Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub> to repair cartilage lesions.,"Cartilage repair is a significant clinical issue due to its restricted ability to regenerate and self-heal after cartilage lesions or degenerative disease. Herein, a nano-elemental selenium particle (chondroitin sulfate A‑selenium nanoparticle, CSA-SeNP) is developed by the supramolecular self-assembly of Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub> and negatively charged chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) via electrostatic interactions or hydrogen bonds followed by in-situ reducing of l-ascorbic acid for cartilage lesions repair. The constructed micelle exhibits a hydrodynamic particle size of 171.50 ± 2.40 nm and an exceptionally high selenium loading capacity (9.05 ± 0.03 %) and can promote chondrocyte proliferation, increase cartilage thickness, and improve the ultrastructure of chondrocytes and organelles. It mainly enhances the sulfation modification of chondroitin sulfate by up-regulating the expression of chondroitin sulfate 4-O sulfotransferase-1, -2, -3, which in turn promotes the expression of aggrecan to repair articular and epiphyseal-plate cartilage lesions. The micelles combine the bio-activity of CSA with selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs), which are less toxic than Na<sub>2</sub>SeO<sub>3</sub>, and low doses of CSA-SeNP are even superior to inorganic selenium in repairing cartilage lesions in rats. Thus, the developed CSA-SeNP is anticipated to be a promising selenium supplementation preparation in clinical application to address the difficulty of healing cartilage lesions with outstanding repair effects.",Carbohydrate polymers,eng,2023,Sep
Attenuation of Abnormal Scarring Using Spherical Nucleic Acids Targeting Transforming Growth Factor Beta 1.,"Abnormal scarring is a consequence of dysregulation in the wound healing process, with limited options for effective and noninvasive therapies. Given the ability of spherical nucleic acids (SNAs) to penetrate skin and regulate gene expression within, we investigated whether gold-core SNAs (AuSNAs) and liposome-core SNAs (LSNAs) bearing antisense oligonucleotides targeting transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-<i>β</i>1) can function as a topical therapy for scarring. Importantly, both SNA constructs appreciably downregulated TGF-<i>β</i>1 protein expression in primary hypertrophic and keloid scar fibroblasts in vitro. In vivo, topically applied AuSNAs and LSNAs downregulated TGF-<i>β</i>1 protein expression levels and improved scar histology as determined by the scar elevation index. These data underscore the potential of SNAs as a localized, self-manageable treatment for skin-related diseases and disorders that are driven by increased gene expression.",ACS applied bio materials,eng,2020,Dec

The anti-ovarian cancer effect of RPV modified paclitaxel plus schisandra B liposomes in SK-OV-3 cells and tumor-bearing mice.,"Due to poor targeting ability of anti-tumor drugs and self-adaptation of tumors, the chemotherapy of ovarian cancer is still poorly effective. In recent years, the treatment of tumor with nano-targeted agents has become a potential research focus.

MicroRNA-30c delivered by bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells induced apoptosis and diminished cell invasion in U-251 glioblastoma cell line.,"Glioblastoma multiform (GBM) is the most belligerent and prevalent brain malignancy among adults. Due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB), drug administration is confronted by massive challenges, making resectional surgery the only treatment pipeline. MicroRNAs have recently absorbed the attention of studies for correlating with the progression of various malignancies. miR-30c has been reported to play a role in cell proliferation, metabolism, and apoptosis process. For instance, miR-30c has been reported to regulate apoptosis through the TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). miR-30c also targets IL-6, which further induces apoptosis. Besides, miR-30c inhibits glioma proliferation and its migratory ability. Besides, the overexpression of miR-30c arrested cells at G0 as well as dampening their migration and invasion. However, it has been shown that the expression level of miR-30c was low in glioma. MSCs can migrate toward tumor cells which is called tumor-tropism, in which they are capable of delivering engineered miR-30c based on gap junction and non-intimacy mechanisms.",Life sciences,eng,2021,Aug
Cartilage oligomeric matrix protein gene multilayers inhibit osteogenic differentiation and promote chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.,"There are still many challenges to acquire the optimal integration of biomedical materials with the surrounding tissues. Gene coatings on the surface of biomaterials may offer an effective approach to solve the problem. In order to investigate the gene multilayers mediated differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), gene functionalized films of hyaluronic acid (HA) and lipid-DNA complex (LDc) encoding cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) were constructed in this study via the layer-by-layer self-assembly technique. Characterizations of the HA/DNA multilayered films indicated the successful build-up process. Cells could be directly transfected by gene films and a higher expression could be obtained with the increasing bilayer number. The multilayered films were stable for a long period and DNA could be easily released in an enzymatic condition. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay presented significantly higher (p<0.01) COMP expression of MSCs cultured with HA/COMP multilayered films. Compared with control groups, the osteogenic gene expression levels of MSCs with HA/COMP multilayered films were down-regulated while the chondrogenic gene expression levels were up-regulated. Similarly, the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining and Alizarin red S staining of MSCs with HA/COMP films were weakened while the alcian blue staining was enhanced. These results demonstrated that HA/COMP multilayered films could inhibit osteogenic differentiation and promote chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs, which might provide new insight for physiological ligament-bone healing.",International journal of molecular sciences,eng,2014,Nov

Stem cells intra-articular injection therapy showed a potential therapeutic superiority to reduce OA development and to improve treating outputs. However, the long-term effect of stem cells intra-articular injection on the cartilage regeneration remains unclear. Recently, miR-140-5p was confirmed as a critical positive regulator in chondrogenesis. We hypothesized that hUC-MSCs overexpressing miR-140-5p have better therapeutic effect on osteoarthritis.",Journal of bone and mineral metabolism,eng,2020,May
